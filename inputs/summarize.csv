Manziel and Colleen Crowley were spotted together in public for the first time since he entered rehab when they attended Tuesday night's Texas Rangers game. The pair appear to remain very much an item, but Crowley has been taking heat on Instagram for refusing to give up her wild ways while Manziel was being treated for his unspecified problems. Scroll down for video . Johnny Manziel was spotted at a Texas Rangers game Tuesday night days after leaving rehab . On Tuesday, Crowley posted a video on her Instagram page of the Texan socialite enjoying a drunken night out with friends . Manziel finally re-emerged on the weekend after checking into a  facility on January 28 stating that he wanted to 'be a better family member, friend and teammates.' On Tuesday, Crowley - who has amassed more than 130,000 followers since becoming Johnny Football's girlfriend - posted a video on her Instagram page of the Texan socialite enjoying a drunken night out with friends. The video seemed to enrage a number of followers who voiced their unhappiness that the undergrad at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas may not be setting the best example to someone straight out of rehab. 'F*** you for putting this up after the money man (Manziel) got out of rehab,' commented one follower. Another concerned commenter added some words of warning. 'Significant others are the #1 reason that people fail outside rehab. If you are in rehab, then you have an addictive personality and the drug councilors will atest that one addiction is as good as another for triggering an addict into relapsing.' Crowley has been taking heat on Instagram for refusing to give up her wild ways while Manziel was being treated for his unspecified problems . The party-loving girlfriend of footballer Johnny Manziel has come under fire on social media for refusing to give up on going out and enjoying herself now her boyfriend is out of rehab . Some other commenters on Crowley's Instagram page are more forgiving. 'It's your life, keep doin you and forget the haters,' writers one supporter. The Cleveland Browns quarterback stayed away from the booze on Tuesday night and was seen sipping nothing stronger than water throughout the game. Manziel's partying had been a topic of conversation since his rookie season began last July, with some worried his drinking was a priority . According to ESPN, Manziel was 'doing great' in rehab, and had the full support of his team. Now comes the real test as offseason workouts with the team will begin next Monday, April 20. Manziel will be forced to compete with Josh McCown for the starting quarterback position, who just signed a $14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons. Manziel was joined by his girlfriend Colleen Crowley and sipped water throughout Tuesday night . This after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts. Manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the end of the Cleveland Browns season last December, but talk soon turned to whether or not the accomplished footballer might have a problem. Especially after one incident last year when, after partying until well past midnight, Manziel, who is suffering from an injured hamstring, skipped out on a Saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept, and in turn was fined by the Browns. Manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior, saying; 'It's about being accountable... instead of looking like a jackass.' And while his season may have been over at that time, many believed Manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy. The athlete was in treatment for roughly six weeks before being released on Saturday . It was all the more shocking then when he was spotted partying at FDR Lounge at the Delano in Miami over the New Year holiday, alongside the likes of LeBron James and Ryan Phillippe, and then he was seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend Crowley and some buddies poolside at the Delano. At this point, some in the sports world, chief among them columnist Skip Bayless, began to suggest that the Heisman Trophy winner needed to get help for his drinking. Appearing on ESPN's First Take, Bayless, a noted supporter of Manziel, did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking. 'My concern, I repeatedly said, was if Johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol, and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails, then I'm going to be out,' said Bayless. 'In talking to people in and around the Cleveland Browns, I believe Johnny Manziel continues to have a problem with alcohol. And I believe ... that it is time for Johnny to get some help. Manziel while the 2013 Heisman Trophy as the quarterback of the Texas A&M University Aggies . 'He continues to lie to his executives, to his coaches, to his teammates, to the media, and most of all, he continues to lie to himself.' He then said he would label Manziel an 'alcoholic.' Manziel was known for his partying while at Texas A&M, but said he was a changed man during the 2014 NFL Draft, noting that he had 'grown up,' before being selected 22nd overall by Cleveland. Just days into his training with the Browns however, the local press began calling him out on his partying, which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field. A source told Cleveland.com at the time; 'Team officials had bought into Manziel's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat-boy lifestyle back in College Station, Texas, and they've been stunned by his non-stop antics.'","Colleen Crowley, the party-loving girlfriend of footballer Johnny Manziel, has come under fire on social media for refusing to give up going out .

Paul Casey was at home in Arizona when the matter was decided last Sunday and admitted he went through all sorts of agonies as his Augusta fate swung back and forth. The Englishman got in due to staying in the world's top 50 but at one point, as events unfolded in Morocco and at the Texas Open, he was projected to fall to 54th. Paul Casey, pictured in action last month, is the 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to play at the Masters . 'I was very relieved and now I am just so excited,' said Casey, who made the last of his eight Masters appearances in 2012. 'On the outside looking in is hardly where you want to be for the season's first major. I've missed the whole experience.' The classy ball striker has got all the tools to do well at Augusta and showed as much when he forced his way into contention on several occasions. The 37-year-old finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and actually led in 2007 after five holes of the final round. He then called a penalty shot on himself at the sixth after his ball moved a fraction when he addressed it with his putter. Casey finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and actually led in 2007 after five holes of the final round . It's a stupid rule that has subsequently been changed and Casey said, smiling:'It would be nice to wind the clock back, wouldn't it? It did affect me for a few holes and I fell away (he finished 10th). But I'm going back a lot wiser and far better equipped if I got in contention again.' Casey will wrap up his preparation at the Shell Houston Open, the site of his only PGA Tour victory. Also in the field are Justin Rose, Lee Westwood and a quartet of high class Americans in Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Rickie Fowler and Phil Mickelson. Meanwhile, there's still no word on whether Tiger Woods will play the Masters, although he did at least declare his intent by pitching up for a practice round at Augusta on Tuesday.","Paul Casey was the 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to play at Augusta .

The move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps. The company said at its annual Build conference on Wednesday that it will release new programming tools for software developers to rapidly adapt their Apple and Android apps to run on devices that use the new Windows 10 operating system coming late this year. Scroll down for video . Microsoft hopes to lure more people to use its new Windows 10 software by making it easy to use many of the same apps they're already using on Apple or Android phones. Pictured:  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers his keynote address at Microsoft Build in San Francisco, . New operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever'. Various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8. Users can create multiple desktops to keep things organised. Microsoft also announced a new name for the web browser that it plans to offer with Windows 10. The company promises its new 'Edge' browser is faster and more useful than the Internet Explorer that Microsoft has offered for the last 20 years. The tech giant is making its case for Windows 10 before an army of software developers who may be crucial allies in its campaign to build enthusiasm among consumers for the next version of Microsoft's flagship operating system, coming later this year. 'Our goal is to make Windows 10 the most attractive development platform ever,' Microsoft executive Terry Myerson told an audience of several thousand programmers and app developers. While Microsoft has already previewed some aspects of the new Windows, a parade of top executives is using the Build conference to demonstrate more software features and app-building tools, with an emphasis on mobile devices as well as PCs. Ultimately, they're hoping to win over people who have turned to smartphones and tablets that run on rival operating systems from Google and Apple. During the three-day conference, Microsoft is also expected to show off new Windows smartphones or other devices and reveal more details about such tech initiatives as the company's new Spartan web browser; its Siri-like digital assistant known as Cortana; and the HoloLens, a futuristic 'augmented reality' headset that projects three-dimensional images in a wearer's field of vision. But perhaps most importantly, this year's conference is an opportunity for Microsoft to persuade an audience of more than 5,000 techies and independent programmers that it's worth their time to create new apps and programs for Windows 10. Experts say Microsoft needs a rich variety of apps if it wants to appeal to people who are increasingly using mobile gadgets instead of personal computers. A woman wearing a HoloLens demonstrates how the technology can be used to test and develop robotics at the Microsoft Build conference in San Francisco. Internet Explorer, which was first called Windows Internet Explorer, was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 in 1995. Internet Explorer was one of the most widely used web browsers, attaining a peak of about 95 per cent during 2002 and 2003. However, it struggled in the face of competition, and in May 2012 it was announced that Google's Chrome overtook Internet Explorer as the most used browser worldwide. The brand has struggled to shake off the bad reputation of Internet Explorer 6, which was notoriously insecure. 'Getting developer buy-in is absolutely the crucial thing,' said J.P. Gownder, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. He said Microsoft has struggled with a 'chicken-and-egg' problem, in which developers have been reluctant to build mobile apps for Windows because relatively few people use Windows phones and tablets. Microsoft hopes it has solved that problem by designing Windows 10 so it's easier for developers to build 'universal' apps that work on a variety of Windows devices, from phones to PCs and other gadgets, Gownder said. Currently, there are more than 1.4 million apps for Android phones and about the same for Apple devices, while there are only a few hundred thousand apps that work on Windows phones and tablets. The company also has a big carrot to wave in front of those developers: Microsoft has already said it will release Windows 10 as a free upgrade to people who now have PCs or other gadgets running the previous two versions of Windows, provided they upgrade in the coming year. The offer could create a huge new audience of Windows 10 users in a relatively short time, Gownder said. Myerson predicted there will be a billion devices using Windows 10 - from PCs to phones, tablets, gaming consoles and even holographic computers - within the next two to three years. Microsoft has not said exactly when Windows 10 is coming, and some analysts are hoping the company will announce a release date at the conference, along with details about how it will distribute future upgrades. CEO Satya Nadella and other executives have hinted they'd like to move away from the old notion of selling each new version of Windows as a separate product. Microsoft's had early success in selling its Office productivity software on a subscription basis, in which customers pay an annual fee to use programs like Word, PowerPoint and Excel. A man demonstrates a device using Windows holographic technology during the Microsoft Build conference . Nadella is presiding over a major overhaul of a company that once dominated the tech industry, in the days when PCs were king. He has redesigned some of Microsoft's most popular programs for mobile devices and invested in new 'cloud-computing' services, in which businesses pay to use software that's housed in Microsoft's data centers. Microsoft still relies heavily on selling traditional software for PCs and corporate computer systems. But its latest quarterly earnings report, issued last week, offered some signs that the decline in that business is slowing, while Microsoft's cloud-computing business is growing rapidly. The news drove Microsoft's share price up 10 percent in one day. The stock has continued to rose, trading as high as $49.13 on Wednesday - within a dollar of its 52-week high.","New programming tools can rapidly adapt Apple and Android apps .

But sunseekers are being warned that it could also invalidate their home insurance if they get burgled while they are away. Insurers are increasingly checking people's social media accounts following a break-in to see if they announced they would be away from the property, and are using it as a reason not to pay out. Holidaymakers who announce they are going on a two-week trip or regularly post selfies from the beach on Facebook while they are away could find their insurer refusing to pay out if they are burgled . This is because most insurers have a 'reasonable care' clause, meaning firms don't have to offer up cash if they can prove people weren't careful enough in protecting their possessions. In the past this was used in cases of burglary where doors or windows were left unlocked or open, but increasingly it is being used against holidaymakers who advertise their vacation online. Police forces have repeatedly warned that would-be thieves will check social media to see whether property owners have said they will be away, before striking while nobody is home. According to The Sun, families that post pictures of themselves on sun loungers, or announce they are on the first day of a two-week trip could be deemed to be helping criminals. Most firms include 'reasonable care' clause in contracts, meaning they are not liable if people did not protect their property, and are now using against people who advertise breaks online . Police have repeatedly warned that would-be thieves will often check social networks in order to establish that people are out of their homes before striking . A spokesman for the Financial Ombudsman Service said: 'It's possible that your insurance cover could be affected if you explicitly announce your plans on social media. 'You wouldn't put a poster up on your front lawn saying you're going on holiday.' The Association of British Insurers also warned home owners to 'think carefully about what you put on social media'.","Insurers often check accounts of those burgled while they were away .

Pink is the new colour of choice for high-achieving women in the world of politics and showbusiness and the style is now spreading to the high street. Those championing pink include Christine Lagarde, the first female chief executive of the International Monetary Fund, and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood, who chose a bright shade of the colour  for her live election debate last Thursday. The pair are among a host of powerful women reaching for different shades of pink, according to The Sunday Times newspaper. Scroll down for video . Christine Lagarde, the first female chief executive of the International Monetary Fund, left, in a pink Chanel suit and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood, right, chose hot pink for her live election debate last Thursday . The sudden rise in use among powerful women is said to be down to the way that the colour is perceived - it used to be a girly but is now considered an appropriate shade to wear to a business meeting. In an interview with the newspaper the managing director of image consultants Colour Me Beautiful, Veronique Henderson, said: 'Pink was for a long time viewed as a girlie colour. It was seen as romantic, not serious in business, but that has changed.'

Richard Graham, who is fighting to retain the marginal seat of Gloucester, faces contempt of court proceedings if he fails to obey an order by the High Court to take down the Twitter posts. At an extraordinary pre-trial hearing, the Old Etonian former diplomat was accused of posting the tweets to 'ingratiate himself' with voters by 'whipping up local feeling' about the forthcoming case concerning the killing of a teenager. Richard Graham, who is fighting to retain the marginal seat of Gloucester, faces contempt of court proceedings if he fails to obey an order by the High Court to take down Twitter posts a court case . Zac Evans, 19, was killed in a machete attack outside a pub in Gloucester in January while apparently trying to protect a group of girls. The trial, due to take place in June, was originally set for Bristol Crown Court, 30 miles from Gloucester. But after Mr Graham called for it to be moved during an exchange in the House of Commons and wrote to the Lord Chief Justice, it was transferred to Gloucester Crown Court. It was later switched back to in Bristol following objections that Gloucester would struggle to stage such an emotive case. Zac's family said they preferred the case to be heard in Bristol. The High Court heard concerns by defence lawyers that Mr Graham may have used his political influence to try to get the trial switched from Bristol. They also argued that a number of his Twitter posts could prejudice the trial if not removed from his Twitter account. Zac Evans, 19, was killed in a machete attack outside a pub in Gloucester in January while apparently trying to protect a group of girls . Barrister Stephen Kamlish QC, acting for the defendant in the murder trial, said in court that Mr Graham's tweets were a 'clear attempt to win votes by ingratiating himself with his electors', the MP was 'potentially out of control on the issue' and if he refused to remove his tweets or added to them, the defendant may not get a fair trial. Mr Justice Hamblen ordered Mr Graham to remove the tweets 'as soon as reasonably practicable', and to say nothing more that could prejudice the trial. Mr Graham insisted he was right to speak out about the trial arrangements, but refused to discuss his tweets, which he said had been removed. On the suggestion that he had used the trial for electioneering, he said: 'That's rubbish. 'For an MP not to say anything about an event which filled the cathedral [for Zac's funeral]... no MP is going to sit there and say nothing.' A spokesman for the judiciary said: 'The presiding judge for the area, in consultation with the resident judge, felt it was appropriate to try this case in Gloucester.

7551,108001053b37e8d61251047cdbbdbc8bdec48e94,"(CNN)She predicted events that unfolded in the Middle East well before they happened. And her book on Iraq became required reading for many military leaders trying to understand the country. Veteran journalist and author Sandra Mackey died Sunday, her son, Colin Mackey, said. She was 77. Her extensive career began in anonymity. She was an undercover reporter working for U.S. newspapers from Saudi Arabia as her husband, Dr. Dan Mackey, worked in a Riyadh hospital. For four years, she hid her writing from the authorities and smuggled her stories out of the country to get around Saudi Arabia's prohibition on foreign journalists. Her work appeared under the pseudonym Michael Collins. As she chronicled what was happening around her, Mackey's distinctive voice began to emerge. Over the years, a stream of books followed. ""The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom"" offered ""a rare first-hand glimpse into the hidden realm of Saudi social and public life,"" The New York Times wrote. Her 1992 book ""Passion and Politics: The Turbulent World of the Arabs"" helped bridge gaps in understanding between Arabs and Americans, critics wrote. Mackey wrote for the people she knew, in a layman's language that was rooted in her training as a high school history teacher. ""Scholars may be put off by Mackey's occasionally florid, bombastic language, but her work is a sound analysis and a sympathetic yet balanced effort to explain Arab perspectives to Americans,"" Elizabeth R. Hayford wrote in Library Journal. After earning a history degree from the University of Central Oklahoma, Mackey attended the University of Virginia to study international relations. She graduated in the first class of women admitted to the graduate program. For her book on Iran, Mackey was three times able to win permission to travel through the country unaccompanied, allowing her to paint an intimate portrait of a country going through extraordinary change. Her 2002 book ""The Reckoning -- Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein"" portended some of the outcomes of the war in Iraq -- but also drew some sharp criticism. ""If war prevails, we shall beget a greater disorder in the Persian Gulf,"" Mackey wrote in the book. ""We will be sucked into the resentments of the Arab world, the hostilities of the Iraqis, and the challenge of nation building in what has become an intensely tribal society at the core of American vital interests in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.'' Fouad Ajami, the late Hoover Institute fellow who was also a frequent guest on CNN, took issue with the book. ""The crowds in Baghdad and Basra (like the crowds in Kabul that greeted their liberators with kites and music) may yet embarrass Mackey and the countless naive people who see things her way,""  Ajami wrote for The New York Times' Sunday Book Review cover story in 2002. Mackey had an Oklahoma twang, the slightly nasal kind that she was proud of, but that belied her worldly understanding. She would use it to full effect when she wanted to put people at ease. Mackey was a frequent commentator on CNN during the Gulf War in the 1990s. She also appeared on countless other outlets, including Bill Maher's ""Politically Incorrect,"" to explain in layman's terms what was happening in the region. Her book on Iraq was published one year before the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003. The book forewarned of the consequences of such action. ""In a perfect world, Shia, Sunni, and Kurd, followed by a company of other minorities, would walk into the post-Hussein Iraq as a liberated people united by common suffering,"" Mackey wrote. ""But as all those who plot the way of nations are so acutely aware, the world is not perfect."" She said those calling for an invasion of Iraq ""cannot ignore the threats to American security that could come with Hussein's demise."" ""With American troops on the ground and no governing authority capable of taking charge, the United States faces the real possibility of a secular version of militant Islam,"" Mackey said. ""... Thus, American military forces rotate in and out, U.S. taxpayer money finances the occupation, and Iraqi hostility to a Western presence increases. There is no exit strategy except retreat."" In 2004 the U.S. military actually flew Mackey to Iraq to teach commanders from the Army's 1st Infantry Division while the war was still raging. Her book on Iraq became required reading for many military officers. ""I am literally a little old lady in tennis shoes,"" she used to joke about her ability to gain the confidence of countless sources.  ""What's the harm in talking to me?""","Mackey predicted what would happen to Iraq if the U.S. invaded and deposed Saddam Hussein .

Tewksbury Police Department came under  attack by criminals who infected their network with a form of Internet malware in December before demanding money to decrypt the files. The program called CryptoLocker infects  through an e-mail and then scrambles the data on the computer. It caused police systems to be down between four and five days, according to Tewksbury Town Crier. Tewksbury Police Department (above) came under attack by hackers which encrypted their computers' files using a malware program called CryptoLocker. They were forced to pay a $500 in Bitcoinransom . The only files that were not corrupted were 18 months old, so cops were left paying the ransom in the untraceable digital currency or they risked losing the data forever, according to the Boston Globe. 'Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the Town Crier. 'We did everything we possibly could. 'It was an eye opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort.' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan said: 'It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort' The department was hit with the ransomware on December 7 when access to the infected computers became restricted and a payment was required to recover the files. Police became aware of the malware infection the following day. Computers were hit with a more recent form of CryptoLocker that authorities did not have the key to, said Sheehan. It is believed that the Officer In Charge's computer  became infected and the virus traveled to the largest store of data on the network which held files including arrest logs, motor vehicle records, calls for service and records management, according to the Town Crier. CryptoLocker is malware that is often installed on computers at the same time. CryptoLocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked. Computers can become corrupted through phishing emails that include malicious attachments and pop-up ads. According to reports from last year, the U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files. When a Tewksbury officer tried to access the data, a demand for $500 was sent from a web address and account that is untraceable by authorities including the FBI and National Security Agency. After this sort of infection occurs there are only two options which include accessing the most recent back-up or paying the ransom. As Tewksbury's back-up was corrupted they were forced to pay the ransom, but Sheehan also noted that the malware infection was not a data breach. 'This isn't a breach. [The data] stays interior, but this virus encrypts it and prevents it from being readable,' Sheehan told the Town Crier. Tewksbury is not the first police department to be a victim of ransomware in the U.S. Similar incidents have occurred involving Swansea Police Department which paid a $750 ransom in November 2013, according to Town Crier. Police in Midlothian, Illinois most recently paid a $500 ransom in January.","Tewksbury Police Department was attacked by criminals who infected their network with  malware program called CryptoLocker .

In a letter he sent to his strategic management students, Professor Irwin Horwitz claimed that he had seen cheating, heard false rumors about himself and other students and had been called a 'f****** moron' to his face. Horwitz's email said that every single student in the approximately 30-person class would fail because of the behavior he had witnessed during the semester. The university has said that the failing grades Horwitz's wishes to give out will not hold. Texas A&M, Galveston, professor Irwin Horwitz emailed his strategic management class of about 30 students telling them he was going to fail all of them because of the bad behavior he had seen during the semester . In the email - he sent a similar one to administrators - he claimed students cheated in class and participated in 'inappropriate conduct' His email to his students read: 'None of you, in my opinion, given the behavior in this class, deserve to pass, or graduate to become an Aggie, as you do not in any way embody the honor that the university holds graduates should have within their personal character. 'Since teaching this course, I have caught and seen cheating, been told to 'chill out,' 'get out of my space,' 'go back and teach,' [been] called a 'f****** moron' to my face, [had] one student cheat by signing in for another, one student not showing up but claiming they did, listened to many hurtful and untrue rumors about myself and others, been caught between fights between students….

I will no longer be teaching the course, and all are being awarded a failing grade.' Horwitz, who has taught at the college level for 20 years, sent a similar email to senior administrators telling them what he had done, according to Inside Higher Ed. He predicted that his students would protest his decision and told administration that the students were 'your problem now'. A university spokesman said that across-the-board failing grades would be re-evaluated. 'No student who passes the class academically will be failed. That is only the right thing to do,' he said. He added that Horwitz's accusations are being investigated and 'disciplinary action will be taken' against those students who behaved inappropriately. Horwitz, who said he will not teach the class again, called his class's behavior 'disgraceful' and told KPRC that he had never failed a class before and rarely gave out failing grades. 'I was dealing with cheating, dealing with individuals swearing at me both in and out of class, it got to the point that the school had to put security guards at that class and another class,' he said. 'Sometimes learning incorporates tough love.' Vice President of Academic Affairs Patrick Lauchouarn said that Horwitz cannot give failing grades to an entire class and each student will be judged academically by the department head rather than Horwitz for the remainder of the semester . He said that his students told him to 'chill out' and cited student cheating in his email. 'It became apparent that they couldn't do some of the most simple and basic things they should have been able to do,' Horwitz told KPRC. Vice President of Academic Affairs Patrick Lauchouarn said that Horwitz cannot give failing grades to an entire class, especially before the end of the semester, in May. 'None of them have failed until the end of the class, meaning the only reason a student would fail because he or she has not performed the expectations for that particular class,' he said. The department head at the university will teach the course for the remainder of the semester and grades will be evaluated based on academics, school officials said. Horowitz said he would not teach the strategic management class again at the Galveston campus (pictured) and that in his 20 years of teaching he had never failed an entire class .","Texas A&M, Galveston professor Irwin Horwitz sent an email to his strategic management class telling the approximately-30-person class would all fail .

5552,8b9cbbbaff08d97d161c494dff2d25351d2370dd,"Antarctica has experienced its highest temperature on record, according to meteorologists. Sensors at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula recorded a temperature of 17.5°C (63.5°F). According to meteorologists this is potentially a new record for the warmest temperature measured on the frozen continent. The new temperature record was measured on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (pictured) where the ice shelf covering the sea has declined considerably in recent years and glaciers are thought to be receding . Over a two day period last week temperatures reached 17.4°C (63.3°F) and 17.5°C (63.5°F). However, the heatwave on the coldest continent on Earth has still to be officially certified by the World Meteorological Organisation. Antarctica's icy edge is disappearing in warming ocean waters, with the last decade seeing the rate of ice loss increase dramatically. This is according to a new study that has combined 18-years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites. The researchers claim that some ice shelves in West Antarctica have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years. Satellite data from 1994 to . 2012 clearly shows the accelerating decline which could hasten the rise in global sea levels, . scientists say. The findings come amid concern among many scientists about the effects of . global climate change on Earth's vast, remote polar regions. The previous hottest temperature recorded in Antarctica - which is usually the coldest place on Earth - was in April 24 1961 when the temperature reached 17.1°C (62.8°F). Writing for website Weather Underground, meteorologist Dr Jeff Masters said: 'A new all-time temperature record for an entire continent is a rare event. 'This week's record temperatures were made possible by an unusually extreme jet stream contortion that brought a strong ridge of high pressure over the Antarctic Peninsula, allowing warm air from South America to push southwards over Antarctica. 'At the surface, west to east blowing winds over the Antarctic Peninsula rose up over the 1,000-foot high mountains just to the west of Esperanza Base, then descended and warmed via adiabatic compression (without transfer of heat) into a warm foehn wind (a warm dry wind that blows down a slope).' Antarctica is known as the coldest place on Earth where temperatures have dropped to -93.2°C (-135.8°F) on the East Antarctic Plateau. The graphic above shows rates of thickness change around the Antarctic coastline with areas of most loss in the past 18 years indicated by red circles and areas where ice has increased shown by blue circles . However, the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest warming spots on Earth. While most of the continent has experienced an increase in ice sheet mass, nearly 10,000 square miles of ice has been lost from the ice shelves off coast of the Peninsula. Glaciers extending out from the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula have also been retreating, according to researchers. Climate scientists have blamed the changes happening there on human-generated global warming. The collapse of the Larson B shelf (shown above) on the Antarctic Peninsula is one example of the changes that have been taking place on the continent in recent years and have caused concern among some scientists . Marine sediment cores suggest the changes happening in the area are unprecedented at least in the past 10,000 years. Dr Masters said last week's heatwave matched a trend occurring around the world. He said that in 2015 five nations or territories have now set all time records or matched their records for hottest temperatures in history. He added that 46 nations or territories, out of 235, have set or tied all time heat records since 2010. However, despite the new record temperature, climate scientists are urging caution about drawing conclusions from it. This graphic shows how warm water from the ocean may be increasing the flow of glaciers from the Antarctic ice sheet as they cause melting from below while fresh snow accumulates on top of the ice sheet . Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist with Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, told National Geographic that last year Antarctica also logged a record cold temperature. He said that long term climate changes in Antarctica are complex and still have not been complained properly. The new record will also depend on what scientists regard as being Antarctica. Currently the World Meteorological Society records the warmest temperature on the continent as being at Vanda Station on the opposite side Antarctica on 1 May 1974 when temperatures reached 15°C (59°F).","Temperatures at Esperanza Base on Antarctic Peninsula reached 63.5°F .

Researchers discovered more than two-thirds (69 per cent) of people taking antidepressants did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder, which is also known as clinical depression. Antidepressants are also prescribed for other psychiatric disorders. But the researchers found 38 per cent of those taking the drugs did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia or generalised anxiety disorder either. Scroll down for video . More than two thirds of people taking antidepressants did not meet the criteria for clinical depression . The U.S. investigators looked at those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), the most commonly prescribed type of anti-depressant. SSRIs are usually the first choice medication for depression and other psychiatric conditions because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant. Writing in the report,  published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, the researchers concluded: 'Many individuals prescribed antidepressants may not have met the criteria for mental disorders. 'Our data indicates that antidepressants are commonly used in the absence of clear evidence-based indications.' Commenting on the study, Dr Howard Forman, medical director of the Addiction Consultation Service at Montefiore Medical Center, said clinical depression is distinct from temporary feelings of sadness. He told Medical Daily: 'We all experience periods of stress, periods of sadness, and periods of self-doubt. 'These don't make us mentally ill, they define us as human.' In the U.S., official guidelines say clinical depression should be diagnosed if a person has five or more depressive symptoms over a two week period, most of the day, nearly every day. The symptoms include a depressed mood; a loss of interested or pleasure in activities; weight loss, weight gain or changes in appetite; insomnia or increased desire to sleep.

Other symptoms included restlessness or slowed behaviour; fatigue or loss of energy; feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt; difficulty making decisions or trouble concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide. Prescriptions for anti-depressants have more than trebled since 1998 in the world's richest countries, a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found. The research noted a particular rise in in the use of SSRIs like Prozac and Seroxat. The OECD figures showed Iceland to have the highest prescribing rate, at 106 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011, up from 71 a decade earlier. Behind Iceland is Australia, then Canada, Denmark, Sweden and Portugal. The lowest levels were seen in Chile and South Korea. Separate data from the US shows 11 per cent of Americans over 12-years-old use anti-depressants. As part of the new study, doctors used data from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Study Wave 1, which began in 1981, up to Wave 4, which ended in 2005. In total, they used data on 1,071 participants, carrying out four interviews and assessing the use of antidepressants. They found 13 per cent of people in the group reported using antidepressants. The study found 38 per cent of SSRI users did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder or clinical depression (file photo) It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing the levels of a chemical called serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as 'reuptake'). SSRIs work by blocking ('inhibiting') reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. The NHS Choices website while it would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment. Source: NHS Choices . They then assessed whether the people in this group met the criteria for a mental disorder, as laid out in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the U.S. bible for psychiatric conditions. They found that 38 per cent of SSRI users did not meet the criteria for a mental disorder, and 69 per cent did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder. The news comes after a study found women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with autism. The U.S. study supports previous research which has shown that taking SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy increases a woman's risk of having a child with the developmental disability. And other American research revealed young adults taking high-dose antidepressants such as Prozac and Seroxat have double the risk of suicidal behaviour. Researchers pointed to previous studies, which found antidepressant drugs are linked with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thoughts in children and adolescents, particularly in the early stages of treatment.","Study analysed those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

The Portuguese star has devoted hours on the training field to mastering the art of the perfect set-piece, but even the best in the business occasionally get it wrong. In the white-hot atmosphere of the Santiago Bernabeu prior to Wednesday night's second-leg Champions League quarter-final, when every minute of preparation is key, there was still time for Ronaldo to display a small but heartfelt act of kindness. Cristiano Ronaldo shows his delight after Real Madrid finally broke the deadlock against rivals Atletico . But it was a different story before the game as Ronaldo expressed his concern after his shot hit a supporter . After completing his warm-up routine Ronaldo went over to the touchline and lifted off his training shirt . After receiving the forward's shirt the young supporter was clearly overcome with emotion at the kind act . As the former Manchester United forward trained his sights with long-range attempts, one effort flew wide of the target and into the crowd, striking a young supporter in the front row. Ronaldo winced as he realised the extent of the damage his shot had caused but was ordered to continue preparing for the crucial tie with the rest of Carlo Ancelotti's group. Video courtesy of Sport1, The Netherlands . Once the final sprint drill had been completed, however, the 30-year-old made a dash for the supporter and removed his training shirt. In a classy gesture, Ronaldo offered the young boy the warm-up garment as a consolation for being on the receiving end of his venomous shot. Unsurprisingly, the young Madridista was star-struck by the warm deed, becoming teary-eyed at the unexpected turn of events. Madrid made hard work of a well-drilled Atletico side, but it was poster-boy Ronaldo's pass into Javier Hernandez that killed off the valiant attempts of Diego Simeone's 10 men in the 88th minute of the local affair - much to the delight of the stricken fan and the majority of those at the Bernabeu. Ronaldo's training shirt can be seen scrunched up in the hands of the star-struck supporter on the sideline .","Cristiano Ronaldo's practice shot flies into the crowd hitting young fan .

11035,5290556890fbe6cad9ae62b43579be1ca3f29caa,"Former Cuban president Fidel Castro has appeared in public for the first time in more than a year, his first since his country reached a landmark agreement with the US to reestablish ties. The state-run Cubadebate website says Castro greeted a group of Venezuelans visiting the capital of Havana. Cubadebate on Friday published four images that show Castro sitting inside a bus, each with a different person stretching an arm through the window to shake his hand. Images of Fidel Castro meeting with Venezuelan visitors to Havana were reported in Cuban media on Friday, though the encounters were said to take place on Monday . The meetings, with photos taken inside Castro's bus, are the former president's first public appearance since January 2014 . Castro's face is largely obscured by a dark-colored baseball cap. He sports longish gray hair and a beard. The website said the encounter occurred Monday, but did not explain the delay in publishing the photos. He is shown shaking hands, which Cubandebate said occurred 'for hours,' with Venezuelans in Havana who had come for solidarity events. Castro will turn 89 on Aug. 13. He was last seen in public at the inauguration of an artist's studio in January 2014. In February and March of this year, official Cuban media published photographs of Castro taken during private meetings with a Cuban student leader and with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. State media reports about the event said that Castro was 'full of vitality' and shook hands 'for hours' before going to a school . Castro, whose country has close ties with the leftist Venezuelan government, said that the South American country had become the target of 'imperial greed' Though Monday's reported appearance is his first in public since a landmark deal to reestablish ties between the US and Cuba, Castro met with spies released by the US in the agreement earlier this year . He also appeared with the Cuban agents who were freed from prison in December after a landmark agreement between the Obama administration and his brother Raul to reestablish ties between the island and the US. Fidel, older than his brother by five years, expressed skepticism about the deal, which includes plans for a US Embassy in Havana and has lessened travel restrictions. Cuban media said that Castro's meeting went off 'without the slightest of problems' and he urged his residents to write to Obama and urge him to stop saying that Venezuela y was a threat. It said that the former leader talked about how the South American country had become a target for 'imperial greed'. The American president signed sanctions against several Venezuelan officials earlier this year. Castro, whose recent public appearances often largely serve the function of proving that he is alive, was said to be 'full of vitality'. He also reportedly stopped and spoke at a school. The former revolutionary stepped aside temporarily as president due to serious illness in July 2006, and Raul took over permanently in February 2008 after he was elected the country's new leader. Fidel Castro took over Cuba after the fall of the Batista military dictatorship. Raul Castro (left) is five years younger than his brother and has taken over as president of Cuba.

A community is rallying around a defenceless man who was viciously beaten in a sustained and sickening attack by a gang of thugs - because he's autistic. More than 1,500 people have come out in support of Gareth Blanks after the attack that saw him kicked and punched more than 20 times. Mr Blanks, 31, was walking home after buying a chocolate bar when he was approached by a group of three men and one woman at around 8.30pm on April 17. He was taunted by the group before snatching the hat from his head. When he tried to retrieve the garment,  he was pushed to the ground, and one of the males punched and kicked him 20 times in the head and across his body. Mr Blanks is now recovering at his home in Truro, Cornwall, but his family say it will take him a long time to recover, and he has been left with deep mental scars. An online support group called Support Gareth, which has already attracted over 1,500 likes on Facebook with several leaving messages of support. His mother, Sandra, 54, who works as a dinner lady  said: 'He's still very distraught, he's shook up and it's going to take him some time before he can go out on his own again. 'They clearly targeted because of his condition. He does look vulnerable and walks around in his own little world. They didn't take anything about from his hat so their intention was clearly just to take the mickey out of him. 'When he came in, he was crying and really upset. 'As a mum, it was horrific to see. I am now just spending all my time trying to get my son sorted out. 'All the support he has got has been a tremendous help and we are so grateful. 'But this will take him a long time to get over. The physical scars will heal a lot quicker than the mental ones.' Mrs Blanks, who has five children Kelly, 33, Samantha, 27, Lyndsey, 29, and Roy, 34, added: 'I really think need the people responsible need help themselves.

The Chelsea star reached 100 Premier League appearances for the Blues at QPR on Sunday and has been lauded for his fine performances for Jose Mourinho's side this season. Sky Sports pundit Souness believes Hazard, who has 35 goals and 25 assists in his century of Premier League games, will be named the PFA Player of the Year. Eden Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March . 'He's got dancing feet hasn't he? When he runs with the ball it's never more than nine inches away from his feet,' Souness told Sky Sports. 'So if you're a defender, the minute you stick out a foot, he's skipped past you,' added Souness. 'He's got great feet and looks to be a strong boy too. If you look at him he's all there, if he wants to stand up to challenges he definitely can.' Having grown into an integral part of Chelsea's attack, Souness compares the rapid Belgian with leading world stars such as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Hazard warms up at Loftus Road ahead of the clash with QPR, his 100th Premier League game for Chelsea . Jose Mourinho believes that 'it shouldn't even be a debate' that Hazard should claim PFA Player of the Year . 'The way he goes past players, he makes good players look ordinary. He's a bit like Messi and Ronaldo in that when you see them go past people, you think “that's bad defending”, but no it's not not. These guys are just that good and Hazard is close to that category.' 'He certainly needs more goals for me but he's one of the few players that gets you on the edge of your seat every time you watch him play,' added Souness. 'I still think there is much more to come from him in the future.'

7579,efdb6043cf2ac2663137f8cb8696f0735ee58b86,"(CNN)When Al-Shabaab gunmen slaughtered 147 people at a college campus in Garissa, Kenya, on Thursday, it was the bloodiest blow Islamist extremists have dealt to the country since the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. But it was also yet another pave stone in the long path of violence between Kenya and the Somali militants. To understand Thursday's attack, one must understand this: Kenya and Al-Shabaab are at war. Although al Qaeda was behind the 1998 attack that killed more than 200 people, Al-Shabaab has killed many more Kenyans and is by far the country's most persistent tormenter, according to a University of Maryland study. Their attacks have notched up since 2008. And in October 2011, Kenya Defense Forces invaded Somalia, where Al-Shabaab is based, with the crushing Operation Linda Nchi, Swahili for ""Protect the Country."" Thus began a bloody vicious cycle, with Al-Shabaab retaliating on Kenyan soil with ever more spectacular mass killings. Here are some of the most heinous attacks on Kenya by the Somali terrorist group. Early Thursday, while many students still slept, at least four gunman burst into a Christian prayer service at Garissa University College, leading into Easter Weekend. They shot students and took hostages, whom they herded across campus. As they encountered students, they separated them into Muslims and Christians. They spared the former, eyewitness Joel Ayora said. They killed the latter. Kenyan special forces moved in at the campus located about 90 miles from Somalia's southern border. They killed four gunman, but not before 147 victims were shot dead. In December, Al-Shabaab militants carried out the same macabre division of captives by religion at a rock quarry not far from the Somali border. They shot Christian workers dead, and spared their Muslim colleagues. Red Cross Workers counted at least 36 bodies dumped into the quarry. It was eye-for-an-eye retaliation, the militants said, for raids Kenyan security forces carried out on mosques intended to weed out extremists. Parallel to Operation Linda Nchi, Kenya has gone after ethnic Somalis within their own borders triggering protest by Human Rights Watch, which has accused the government of ethnic profiling and mistreatment. In a 2011 case, Kenyan authorities reportedly rounded up ethnic Somalis in Garissa and let them sit in the mud, while beating some of them, HRW alleged. Passengers on a bus in Kenya's north were told to recite from the Quran or die in November 2014. Shortly after the bus carrying some 60 people departed Mandera, near Somalia's border, Al-Shabaab gunmen stopped it in a hilly area and barged in. Those who failed to recite verses were gunned down, leaving 28 dead. In its claim of responsibility, Al-Shabaab said the dead were Christians, and their killing was retaliation mosque raids by Kenyans. A day after the attack, Kenyan security forces retaliated with an offensive across the border into Somalia. They claimed to kill 100 Al-Shabaab militants. In July, Al-Shabaab gunmen opened fire on the Lamu coast, a popular tourist region, and at a police station in a neighboring county.  They killed 22 people. Last May, tour companies evacuated vacationers from Kenya after the UK and United States issued alerts that there was a high threat of attacks. Before the Garissa massacre, the Westgate Mall attack was the deepest wound Al-Shabaab had inflicted on Kenya. For four days, four attackers turned the luxury shopping mall in the capital Nairobi into a cauldron of blood, smoke and rubble. Part of the mall collapsed as Kenyan security forces fought for control. At least 61 civilians were killed, as well as a handful of security officers. Al-Shabaab said the attack was retaliation for Kenya participation in Africa Union military operations in Somalia. Even with Al-Shabaab's shooting in Garissa, al Qaeda's bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998 remains the single bloodiest Islamist terror attack on Kenyan soil. In short succession, bombs detonated at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania back then. The Nairobi bombing was much deadlier that the explosion at Dar es Salaam. Al Qaeda founding member Mamdouh Mahmud Salim was arrested and accused in the bombing and is being held in a New York jail, where he still awaits trial. He is serving a 32 year sentence after being convicted of stabbing a prison guard there in the eye.","To understand Thursday's attack, one must understand that Kenya and Al-Shabaab are at war .

Daria Rose, 18, immersed herself in her studies after she and her family lost everything -- including their home -- when the superstorm hit in October 2012. And after a difficult high school experience, the 18-year-old has a bright future ahead of her. The Hempstead teen has been accepted into all seven of the Ivy League schools she applied to, ABC news reports. Scroll down for video . Acceptance: New York teen Daria Rose (photographed) lost everything in Hurricane Sandy and was recently accepted to seven Ivy League schools . Dreams: The frequent moves Rose and her family underwent after the superstorm made finishing school work difficult for Rose, but she never gave up on her dream of attending an Ivy League school . 'I was like, oh my God, I just got into Harvard,' Rose told ABC 7. 'Then I checked Princeton, and I was like, oh my God I, just got into Princeton. And I checked Brown, I got in. It just kept going and going.' Rose did not apply to Columbia, according to ABC. Rose and her family lived in several hotels as well as her grandmother's house after being forced to evacuate their home in Baldwin, which was destroyed, ABC News reports. After more than a year, the family moved into a new home in Baldwin. Although the frequent moves made finishing school work difficult, Rose said, she never gave up on her dream of attending an Ivy League school. 'I was living in these small spaces but in my head I was able to escape,' Rose said 'find myself in a literary world.' Rose wrote about her Hurricane Sandy experience in a college application essay in which she talked about the storm and how reading helped her cope. Secure: A college essay about her experience helped Rose to secure a spot in Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Brown . Blessing: Rose's mother, Katrina Brooks (left), said that the family's experience turned out to be a blessing because the teen had something substantial to write to the schools' admissions offices . The essay helped the Sacred Heart Academy student secure a spot in Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Brown. 'After moving so much and meeting so many different people, I learned I can adapt and adjust to all these different situations and people,' Rose told ABC 7. Rose's mother, Katrina Brooks, said that the family's experience turned out to be a blessing because it provided the teen with something substantial to write to the schools' admissions offices. 'It's easy to say 'I'm just going to lay here in a ball and cry and wallow in my own self pity,'' Brooks said. 'I'd make sure she'd get up and put one foot in front of the other.' Destroyed: Rose and her family lived in several hotels as well as her grandmother's house after being forced to evacuate their home in Baldwin (photographed), which was destroyed . New Home: After more than a year, the family moved into a new home in Baldwin (photographed is wreckage of Rose's home following the storm) While Rose said she had always leaned toward Yale, in her junior year of high school, she began looking at other options and decided to apply to the seven schools. Rose applied to seven of the eight Ivy League schools and, on March 31, the schools posted their decisions online, according to ABC. 'They're all such great schools,' Rose said. '[I'll] try to see where I'll fit in the best.' Rose said she plans to study political science and Russian literature.

9576,1eb9bc47253906f489dbcbc570246077dd7fbfac,"Jerusalem is a city that conjures up a sense of the holy, the historical and heavenly. The biblical city has been a magnet for pilgrims devoted to several of the world's faiths and religions, notably Jews, Christians and Muslims. Millions flock to the ancient, religious city every year. But for a small percentage, their excitement induced by their close proximity to  holy landmarks invokes a rare condition known as Jerusalem syndrome. First identified in 2000,  psychologists noted religious pilgrims overcome with excitement at being in close proximity to the city's holy places believed they were Biblical characters. It is characterised by anxiety, agitation and nervousness. And sufferers are often consumed by a need to be clean, before donning a toga-like gown often made from hotel bed linen. Jerusalem syndrome affects people visiting the holy city. It is characterised by seven stages, including anxiety, the need to be clean and performing sermons . The next stage sees sufferers overcome by the need to scream, or sing out loud psalms, verses from the Bible, religious hymns or spirituals. A procession or march to one of the city's holy places, is then finally followed by the delivery of a 'sermon'. The condition, which was first reported in 2000, often affects people with no history of mental health problems, LiveScience reports. However, in many other cases, experts believe the condition is likely part of a broader psychosis, that is not unique to Jerusalem. Simon Rego, director of psychology training at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Centre in New York, told LiveScience: 'You see things like this emerge periodically in the literature, where people think they have found a unique syndrome.' But, he said, it may simply be the result of an underlying mental illness. A study, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, noted that since 1980, Jerusalem's psychiatrists had encountered an ever-increasing number of tourists who, upon arriving in the city 'suffer psychotic decompensation'. A study published in the British Journal of Psychology identified seven sequential stages of Jerusalem syndrome: . 1. Anxiety, agitation, nervousness and tension, and other unspecified reactions. 2. Declaration of the desire to split away from the group or the family and to tour Jerusalem alone. Tourist guides aware of the Jerusalem syndrome and of the significance of such declarations may at this point refer the tourist to our institution for psychiatric evaluation in an attempt to pre-empt the subsequent stages of the syndrome. 3. A need to be clean and pure, an obsession with taking baths and showers and compulsive fingernail and toenail cutting. 4. Preparation, often with the aid of hotel bed linen, of a long, ankle-length, togalike gown, which is always white. 5. The need to scream, shout, or sing out loud psalms, verses from the Bible, religious hymns or spirituals. Manifestations of this type serve as a warning to hotel personnel and tourist guides, who should then attempt to have the tourist taken for professional treatment. Failing this, the two last stages will develop. 6. A procession or march to one of Jerusalem's holy places. 7. Delivery of a 'sermon' in a holy place. The sermon is usually very confused and based on an unrealistic plea to humankind to adopt a more wholesome, moral, simple way of life. As a result of noting 'the consistently high incidence of this phenomenon', a decision was taken to channel all cases to one central facility - the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Centre. There patients received psychological counselling, psychiatric intervention and, if deemed necessary, admission to hospital. Over a 13-year period, from 1980 to 1993, 1,200 tourists with severe mental illness invoked by Jerusalem, were referred to the facility. Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, the study found 100 such tourists were seen by experts annually, with 40 a year requiring admission to hospital. Through the course of their study, the researchers identified three types of people affected by Jerusalem syndrome. The first included individuals already diagnosed as having a mental health illness before visiting Israel. Those patients were found to strongly identify with characters from the Old and New Testament. The study referenced one example of an American tourist suffering paranoid schizophrenia, who believed he was the biblical character Samson. He visited Israel because he was compelled to move one of the giant stone blocks forming the Western (Wailing) Wall which, in his opinion, was not in the right place. On arriving at the Western Wall, he attempted to move one of the stones. But his actions instigated a commotion, which resulted in his being admitted to the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Centre. The second group includes those people with personality disorders and obsessions with fixed ideas, but who do not have a clear mental illness. Researchers cited the case of a healthy German man who was obsessed with finding the 'true' religion, and travelled to Jerusalem to study Judaism. He ended up suffering a psychotic episode in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built on the site where Jesus is believed to have been crucified and buried. Three types of patient were identified, the first group being those with already underlying mental illness. One example was of an American tourist suffering paranoid schizophrenia, who believed he was the biblical character Samson. He visited Israel because he was compelled to move one of the giant stone blocks forming the Western (Wailing) Wall, pictured, which, in his opinion, was not in the right place . And the third type of patient, identified in the study, were those with no history of mental illness, but who experienced a psychotic episode while in the city. This group recovered spontaneously after leaving Israel. of the 1,200 patients examined, just 42 fell into the third category. Despite the study, the notion of Jerusalem has been condemned by a number of experts. Dr Alan Manevitz, of New York's Lenox Hill Hospital, told LiveScience he believes the condition may happen when a person who is at risk of psychosis experiences the stress of travelling to another country. 'I think what happens is, vulnerable people can be inspired by the circumstances around them,' he said. Dr Rego, agreed the condition may not be unique to Jerusalem. 'If it was purely causal, you would expect everybody who visits Jerusalem to get it,' he said.","Experts first identified the rare condition in 2000, noting seven symptoms .

'We shared a touching moment with Mumia in an effort to raise his spirits,' Fernandez reported. 'Two teachers delivered letters to us that their students had written to Mumia.' 'It had been a long time since we had seen Mumia smile. 'He chuckled as he read excerpts from these touching letters.' The letters themselves or what they said were not released. However the fact they were written and then sent has infuriated many. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. 'I think its both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Costello told Fox News. 'He shot (the officer) in the back and then as the officer lay slumped against a wall helpless he leaned over and shot him between the eyes. 'When he was in the hospital he actually bragged about it.' Controversial: Marylin Zunig, a teacher at Forest Street School in Orange, New Jersey, had her third graders wrote letters to Mumia Abu-Jamal. The letters have subsequently sparked outrage . Costello said all the teachers involved in the letter writing campaign should be fired. 'Furthermore all the parents who have children in that school system need to reevaluate that involvement, because these children are now placed in danger by the very people charged with their education,' Costello said. 'They are being used as tools in someone's twisted agenda.' Costello has previously described Abu-Jamal as 'the devil'. The official reason the convicted killer was hospitalized has not been released. However reports say he was suffering high blood sugar levels. Attorney Bret Grote with the Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center said last week that his client was placed in the critical care unit of Schuylkill Medical Center in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Grote says neither he nor Abu-Jamal's brother, Keith Cook, had been allowed in to see him. 'We're concerned, about as concerned as it gets, about Mumia's health,' Grote told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Hospitalized: Convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal was placed in the critical care unit of a Pennsylvania hospital last week after collapsing in prison . A Pennsylvania Department of Corrections official also declined to provide details. A spokesman for Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center says he had no information about Abu-Jamal. 'We never discuss an inmate's medical condition,' deputy press secretary Susan Bensinger told the Inquirer. Mumia's hospitalization was revealed Monday when a group of his friends arrived to the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy for a visit and were informed by prison staff that he wasn't there. While Grote and others had permission with the prison to visit Mumia, the hospital had not yet cleared them. Grote said he hoped the matter would be cleared up by Tuesday. Abu-Jamal is a former Black Panther serving life in prison for the 1981 murder of white Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner. Treated: Lawyers with Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center say prison officials told them their client was being treated at Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Mumia's death sentence was overturned in 2012. Abu-Jamal supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show and even has a street named after him in France.

Paul Monk, 54, from Essex, was wanted by Spanish police for questioning over the kidnap and murder of Francis Brennan, whose badly decomposed body washed up on a Costa Blanca beach in March last year. He was also wanted by the Metropolitan Police on drug offences and had been named on a list of fugitives published as part of the National Crime Agency's Operation Captura campaign ahead of his detention.

Taking no chances: The highly trained, well-armed police moved through the house room by room . Paul Monk was on the UK's most wanted list on suspicion of drug trafficking . Brennan, 25, from Liverpool, vanished in the resort of Javea in January last year after being kidnapped by men posing as police. His body was wrapped in an industrial-size bin bag with duct tape round it when it appeared on a beach in nearby Orihuela Costa. Civil Guard officers in Alicante confirmed today they believe Monk, from Essex, may be implicated in the violent death and named him as an associate of Paul Scott. Scott, 32, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine after being caught trying to sneak into Britain in a light aircraft last December. He was also wanted for questioning over Mr Brennan's murder when he was detained. Guardia Civil described him last night as the suspected mastermind of the crime. Monk was detained at a four-bedroom property in Javea near Alicante as he directed workers laying a marble patio around his swimming pool. An imitation firearm with a silencer and nearly £100,000 in cash were also found. He is being held in jail and is expected to be charged and face trial in Spain over Mr Brennan's murder before being extradited to the UK to face questioning over alleged drugs offences. He has been linked to the handover of one kilo of cocaine in Cockfosters, London, in May 2013 and the seizure of 24 kilos of cannabis in Colchester in October 2013. A Civil Guard spokesman said: 'He never left his house as a security measure to avoid being arrested. 'He got other people to bring him food and other things in the villa where he hid out, leading the life of an authentic fugitive.'

Doaa and Umm, whose names have been changed to conceal their identities, were smuggled from Raqqa, in Syria, to southern Turkey after leaving the al-Khansa Brigade earlier this year. The pair said they used to be heavily involved in punishing others who did not obey the group's rules - including giving 60 lashes to those who tried to flee. Scroll down for video . Doaa and Umm (above), whose names have been changed to conceal their identities have revealed what life was like working for the brutal al-Khansa Brigade . In an interview with Sky News Doaa, who left after her Saudi Arabian husband blew himself up in a suicide attack, said women also received a 'standard' 40 lashes if they did not wear proper Islamic dress. The 20-year-old, who was paid around £70 a month by the unit, said: 'What upset me most was lashing old women when they weren't wearing the proper clothes.' Umma, 25, was forced to marry a foreign fighter. She said did not see him very much as he was often on the front line. 'Most of the time I would stay at my parents' house because he wasn't around. He behaved normally, he would come home for two or three days and then go back to fight,' she said, adding that she did not love him. Now the pair, who are living in Turkey illegally, are scared they will be discovered by ISIS fighters who, they believe, are following them. The al-Khansa Brigade operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa. The women revealed they used to be heavily involved in punishing others who did not obey the group's rules - including those who tried to escape. Above, one of the women shows a picture of herself holding a gun . The al-Khansa Brigade operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa. Above, other women from the brigade are pictured holding guns . It achieved notoriety last year after women who travelled to join the Islamic State's insurgency boasted of joining the police unit. They used social media to brag about doling out savage beatings and lashings, ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of sex slaves are believed to be imprisoned and raped daily. In the brigade's first manifesto, released in February, women are told to live a completely 'sedentary' lifestyle. It adds that their role should be primarily to remain 'hidden and veiled' and at the service of men, who are described as their masters. While it claims not to have been written or approved by ISIS's leadership, it provides a disturbing look at the way women are treated. Last September a Syrian woman agreed to carry a hidden camera to film daily life in Raqqa. Her footage showed several gun-wielding French women who had left their home country to join ISIS (above) The women's revelations come a day after a shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya was released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the east of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', were lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others were filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. It followed another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film.","Doaa and Umm were smuggled from Raqqa, in Syria, to southern Turkey .

4412,51f2391f2874ba47d23752f9dbbe909bb2c0b69d,"The parents of a newborn baby girl have spoken of their heartbreak after  she was born without any eyes. Mother-of-three Danielle Davis, 24, refused a termination when a routine scan showed her baby had a cyst on the brain. But when Daisy was born, Ms Davis and her partner Andrew Smith, 31, were told she had the rare disorder Anophthalmia, meaning she had no eyes. The condition is incurable, and so while Daisy can be fitted with glass eyes as she gets older, she will never be able to see. Danielle Davis, 24, has told of her heartbreak as her daughter Daisy, now eight weeks old, was born without any eyes . Daisy suffers from Anopthalmia, a rare condition which means 'lack of eyes'. Daisy will never be able to see, but some children with the disease have prosthetic eyes fitted for cosmetic reasons . Ms Davis refused a termination when a scan revealed a brain cyst, and says she 'has no regrets'. Daisy is now at home enjoying time with her mother Danielle, father Andrew, 31, and siblings Logan, six, and Tyler, four . Ms Davis, a care worker from Cwmbran, South Wales, said: 'It was a shock - we had never heard of it before and neither had any of our friends or family. 'People didn't really know what to say when we told them. 'But she is our gorgeous baby and we have no regrets about turning down a termination. 'We want to give Daisy as normal a life as possible and give her the same opportunities as other children.' Anophthalmia is a rare disease in which a baby is born with no eyes. It develops during pregnancy, and affects around one in 10,000 births in the UK. There is sadly no cure. Ms Davis said: 'The cyst showed up on the 21-week scan and naturally, we were worried about it. Anophthalmia means an absence of the eye. A child may be born with one, or both eyes, missing from the eye socket. The rare disorder develops during pregnancy and can be associated with other birth defects. The condition may be caused by genetic mutations and abnormal chromosomes. Researchers also believe that environmental factors, such as exposure to X-rays, chemicals, drugs, pesticides, toxins, radiation, or viruses, increase the risk of anophthalmia, but research is not conclusive. Unfortunately, there is no treatment that will restore vision in children affected by Anophthalmia. Children will need to undergo repeated hospital visits and many have prosthetic eyes to ensure that the bone and soft tissue around the eye socket grows properly and to improve appearance. Source: The Micro and Anopthalmic Children's Society . 'But none of the doctors said our baby could be born blind. 'Everyone has been really supportive and I can't thank the doctors and midwives enough for all of their help.' Daisy, now eight weeks old, is settling in at home with her siblings Logan, six, and Tyler, four. She will be admitted to the Great Ormond Street Hospital later this month for an operation to fit glass eyes. They will be replaced when she is 18-months-old with painted eyes that will look more natural. Her parents are now planning a 12,000 ft skydive to raise funds for the charity RNIB that supports people with sight loss. The couple also want to raise awareness of the condition. Ms Davis said: 'I hope that by raising awareness other parents to be won't experience the same shock that we did if their child has the condition.' The news comes after MailOnline reported on the story of baby Richie, who was also born without eyes, in January. Staff at Arizona's Banner Desert Medical Center initially thought  Richie's face was swollen at birth. But they were stunned to discover the reason his eyelids would not open was because he had anolpthalmia. Richie's mother Kelly Lopez, from Mesa, Arizona, is optimistic that science will progress enough to help Richie see in his lifetime. Baby Richie Lopez was born with Anopthalmia in January.

7390,0c5ec67f7b1d7a2fdb0a3f3ffb8263d8d9ddf872,"(CNN)Most companies in South Korea have hoesik at least once a month and sometimes every week. Literally, this means dinner with co-workers. In practice, it means official eating/drinking fests involving multiple rounds of alcohol at multiple venues. For the foreign business traveler, using foreignness as an excuse to bow out of the action only goes so far. The pressure to participate is intense. Drinking etiquette is the first thing you teach foreign guests,"" says Bryan Do, a Korean-American director at the South Korean branch of a U.S. company. ""It was shocking when I first arrived in Korea. ""My boss was a graduate of Korea University [renowned for its hardy drinking culture] and at my first hoesik, we started out with everyone filling a beer glass with soju, and downing it on the spot. That was just the beginning."" For Koreans, drinking is considered a way to get to know what someone is really like. ""I didn't really like it in the beginning,"" says Charles Lee, a Korean-Canadian who came to Seoul to work for a South Korean company. ""I was like, 'Why are you making me drink something when I don't want to?' But once I understood the meaning behind it, I appreciated it more. ""There are just some things you can't say at work or talk about over lunch -- people who talk about work at lunch are losers. But when someone offers you a glass of soju, it's an invitation that means that they want to listen to you. ""I thought Koreans were impersonal before I drank with them, so the whole context is important."" Drinking is such a big part of Korean life that Seoul traffic is said to correspond with the city's drinking culture. Mondays are a big night for hoesik, so there are fewer cars during evening rush hour, as most office workers leave them at work so they can go drinking. Tuesdays are a rest day, while Wednesday and Thursday nights are also big nights for company drinking. Fridays have the worst evening traffic, as everyone is taking their cars home to use with their families over the weekend. So how do you avoid offending someone (worst of all, a superior or client) at a Korean drinking extravaganza? Follow these seven handy rules. Koreans always identify the ""higher"" person in the relationship, and defer to them accordingly. One of the first things Koreans often ask when meeting someone new is their age. Even someone just a year older is afforded a language of respect, though age is always superseded by a higher position. It's considered rude for anyone to have an empty glass. If a senior person is pouring -- this usually pertains to hard liquor only -- others shouldn't drink until someone has poured the senior a shot. After all glasses are full, everyone says ""Gunbae!"" and chugs -- usually ""one-shotting"" the entire glass in one go. While downing alcohol, you should turn your body away from senior figures so that your body visually blocks your drinking action from your senior. Always hold bottles or shot glasses with both hands. By raising your glass or pouring alcohol with one hand, you are establishing yourself as a senior person. If you're not, well, you've just breached protocol. It's always a good idea to find out people's drinking habits beforehand. It shouldn't be difficult to find out what people like to drink or how they behave when intoxicated. Hoesik usually involves changing venues for a different type of alcohol -- i.e., round one is dinner, accompanied by beer, round two is soju, round three is for whiskey, and so on. Be ready for each. Unless you have an airtight reason, refusing alcohol is considered a mood killer and deemed rude. Sorry, but ""I don't like soju"" doesn't qualify as a good reason not to punish your liver. Neither would ""I've been on the wagon for three years."" In fact, unless you're pregnant or already puking, what might be a ""good reason"" not to imbibe elsewhere often won't fly here. It's generally best to accept and discreetly get rid of unwanted alcohol (under the table, into your water cup, out the window) than to refuse it. One of the most popular venues in Korea for business drinking is the karaoke bar. Koreans love singing, as evidenced by the country's staggering number of karaoke bars, as well as the rush of audition programs on Korean television. Your companions won't rest until you sing. They'll coax, threaten, push and cajole until you finally take that mic. Be prepared to crack under the immense peer pressure. If you simply cannot take any more, you can call a black knight (male) or a black rose (female) to your rescue. This entails a person of your choosing drinking your glass for you, but it also means they get a wish. As in, you might soon wish you'd just taken that last shot as you're spelling your name out with your butt in front of your client. Bottoms up. Christopher Cha is a Korean-American writer based in Seoul.","Hoesik is the Korean tradition of eating and drinking together .

It is thought the migrants had climbed into the British-registered truck in Belgium before crossing the channel and entering the UK illegally. Police sniffer dogs were used to find them after officers opened the truck's back doors on the A40 near Churcham, Gloucestershire. A group of Afghan men discovered crammed in a refrigerated lorry in Gloucestershire are removed by police . Photos taken by officers show the tiny space the men had climbed into between crates in the packed trailer of the HGV. Gloucestershire police tweeted photos of the moment the men were brought out of the lorry this morning. They tweeted: '[Police dog] Max & his handler assisting on the A40 at Churcham. 5 stowaways on board from Afghanistan. '1 of the 5 men from the refrigerated HGV on the A40 at Churcham.

An eight-strong team have transformed more than 30 telephone booths in China's capital city into a representation of Baymax, who has attracted a cult following in the country. Xiao Wang told The People's Daily Online that he and his fellow graffiti artists – most of them design students – worked through the night to complete project 'Beijing Warmth'. Phone booths in Beijing have been painted in the style of Disney character Baymax by graffiti artists . The team of artists painted 30 phonebooths in five hours overnight, calling the project 'Beijing Warmth' The loveable character Baymax appears in the movie Big Hero 6 about a young boy with a talent for robotics . Starting at midnight, they hit the streets in teams of four to spend five hours working on the phone boxes, using a total of 24 cans of paint. The 28-year-old said that living and working in Beijing is 'very stressful' — adding that he himself had witnessed three people take their own lives in just one month. 'We chose this area due to the higher population of young people', he said, adding he thinks the team's work has improved the road. However their work may soon be removed, after a spokesman from the Haidan Municipal Committee said the phone booths - usually red - should not have been painted a different colour. Artist Xiao Wang said they wanted to raise a smile with burnt-out Beijing residents who live stressful lives . As the Baymax craze sweeps China, a flight school even has their teacher dressing up as the robot . An official from the Beijing Municipal Government said there were no set rules on how to deal with graffiti, and the response was different depending on the content. If the artwork was not offensive and colouring matched the surroundings then it could be allowed to stay, he added. 'Big Hero 6' won the Oscar for the best animated feature in February this year, and its popular character Baymax has a won big following in China after it was released in February. The film became the highest grossing Disney film in China, taking in more than $51 million. Trainee flight attendants at the Sichuan Southwest Vocational College have began dressing like the robot during their lessons, while another craze has seen parents making dumplings in the shape of Baymax to encourage their children to eat.

5627,99c747822fe779b0c65db5d08e4157142241ae42,"Harper Lee was not manipulated into publishing her sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, and is not an elder abuse victim, according to an official probe. State authorities were suspicious that the 88-year-old author, who is reportedly deaf and blind, was somehow pushed into publishing the forthcoming Go Set a Watchman, and launched two investigations into the circumstances surrounding the launch. Many feared outside influences were at play as Lee, who lives in an nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama, had said for decades she wanted To Kill a Mockingbird to be her only published novel. Scroll down for video . Of sound mind: Investigators concluded that Harper Lee, pictured above in 2009, is in a fit state to make decisions about the future of the forthcoming novel Go Set a Watchman . Officials at the state's Department of Human Resources confirmed Monday that their investigation had been completely closed. Earlier Alabama's Securities Commission had sent an investigator to speak with her, and said that she answered their questions well enough to convince them she made her own decision, and knew what was happening with her book. The DHR investigation remained open for a time, but spokesman Barry Spear has confirmed that they are now also satisfied that nothing is amiss. Earlier suspicions had in part been fired by the fact that Lee's attorneys had announced the release, due in July, and that publishing house HarperCollins had not had any direct contact with her. Elderly: Lee lives in this nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama, and has reportedly been deaf and blind since 2007 . Bobby Segall, a lawyer representing Lee's attorney Tonja Carter, confirmed Monday that they received a letter saying that DHR was closing the investigation with no findings. HarperCollins has announced a July 14 release date for Go Set a Watchman, and will print an initial run of 2million copies. The book is high on Amazon's best-seller list despite some concerns about the novel, which Lee wrote before To Kill A Mockingbird. Lee had long expressed that she's happy to have 1960's Mockingbird' - which won a Pulitzer, was adapted into a movie and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide - as her only published book. Go Set a Watchman, a 304-page novel, is a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, although Lee actually wrote it in the mid-1950s, before Mockingbird. Old and new: Go Set a Watchman is a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird - though Lee actually wrote it before the best-selling novel which secured her reputation . The new novel will feature Scout, Mockigbird's protagonist, as an adult woman returning to Maycomb, Alabama from New York City 20 years after the events of To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee thought she had lost the novel's manuscript - but her attorney Tonja Carter found it recently. A statement from Lee, released by HarperCollins, said: 'In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called Go Set a Watchman. 'It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became 'To Kill a Mockingbird') from the point of view of the young Scout. 'I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. Not happy to see him: Reporter Connor Sheets received this blunt, handwritten 'Go away!' from Harper Lee when he asked her repeatedly for an interview . 'After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years.' According to publisher Harper, Carter came upon the manuscript at a 'secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird.' Lee has refused to comment further on the novel, helping fire suspicions about her mental state. One Alabamian reporter who tried for two weeks to secure an interview was eventually rewarded with a hand-written note. It read: 'Go away! Harper Lee.'","Famed author's second novel, Go Set a Watchman, is due out on July 14 .

6739,7042c7a5408a40aa9eb7825374d1f77675c2c4f1,"(CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin shrugged off repeated questions about the impact of Western sanctions on his nation during a nationally broadcast annual Q&A session. ""Sanctions are sanctions,"" he said. ""As far as sanctions are concerned .... (they're) about the need to constrain our development,"" not just about Ukraine and Crimea. Western sanctions were implemented after Moscow annexed Crimea and pro-Russian separatists battled Ukrainian government forces in the nation's east. Putin predicted the sanctions would not end soon. On the Middle East, the Russian leader defended lifting a ban on the sale of a sophisticated air defense system to Iran. ""We need to encourage our Iranian partners,"" Putin said, referring to a preliminary deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Sanctions against Iran have had a dramatic impact on the nation's economy. On Israeli and Western fears that such a system would embolden Iran, Putin scoffed. ""Iran is not a threat to Israel at all,"" he said. ""It is a defense weapon."" Putin's annual exercise is fascinating for ordinary Russians, who normally get him in closely managed doses on state-run television. These sessions are live and can go on and on. Last year, he spoke for three hours and 55 minutes. In 2013, it was a record-setting four hours and 47 minutes. Organizers said public interest was especially strong this year, with 2.4 million questions submitted. Of course, critics of the Kremlin slam the entire event as Russia's imitation of democracy in action. It's hard to imagine a truly critical question, they say, getting aired on national television there. In fact, it's best not to look at this event as an opportunity for Russians to question their leader at all. Instead, it is more like a highly produced, highly choreographed chance for their leader to speak to them, and to the world. Last year, there was a ""surprise"" appearance by NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia. He addressed Putin by video link, quizzing Putin about Moscow's own surveillance practices.","Putin has spent hours fielding questions from the general public on live television .

8219,4b8247ae6af0c71155298fe9582a1b7e6229bbd1,"He has been a colossus of the game. He has made 700 professional club appearances and won 81 caps for England, six Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Champions League. In his pomp, he was the stuff of strikers' nightmares, driving some of the world's greatest goalscorers to distraction with lightning-sharp reactions and an instinctive reading of the game. That's why it's such a shame that what is likely to be Rio Ferdinand's farewell year in the English game has fizzled out. Rio Ferdinand pictured in training at Queens Park Rangers last week. The 36-year-old defender started regularly in the first part of the season but has been unable to hold down his spot in the side . Ferdinand started the first seven matches of QPR's Premier League campaign before being dropped . Ferdinand has enjoyed a fantastic career, winning six Premier League titles, but a fairytale finish is unlikely . Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs lift the European Cup for Manchester United in Moscow back in 2008 . Ferdinand also won 81 caps for England during his glittering career . He would love to be out there, hunting down and hassling opponents, robbing attackers of the ball, winning the aerial duels, playing his part in Queens Park Rangers' survival mission. Keeping them up would be a fitting curtain call. Instead, Ferdinand's season has been one spent on the margins - either suspended, benched or out of the squad altogether. Once again, the 36-year-old was forced to watch on from the sidelines as Rangers claimed a potentially crucial point away to Aston Villa on Tuesday night. Ferdinand had picked up a slight knock and was ruled out. He has played just five times since the start of October - not much of a swansong. On Sunday, he posted a Twitter picture of a pile of chicken bones after lunch at his mum's. He had not been involved in the 4-1 win at West Brom 24 hours earlier and it weirdly seemed to sum up his peripheral role at the moment. By contrast, Ferdinand had started QPR's first seven games of the campaign, lasting the full 90 minutes in all of them. Harry Redknapp had grand plans and the best of intentions last summer. Having called time on his Manchester United career after 12 trophy-laden seasons, Ferdinand moved to Loftus Road in what Redknapp described as a 'remarkable coup for the club.' Harry Redknapp described Ferdinand's signing last summer as a 'remarkable coup' for the club . But after initial promise, Ferdinand has largely spent the season on the bench . Premier League (6): 2002-03, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13 . FA Cup (1): 2003-04 . Football League Cup (2): 2005-06, 2008-09 . FA Community Shield (5): 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013 . Champions League (1): 2007-08 . FIFA Club World Cup (1): 2008 . Even in his mid-thirties, Redknapp believed Ferdinand would bring 'quality, class, experience and know-how' as QPR returned to the top flight. He envisaged Ferdinand in a sweeper role, the central pivot of a three-man defence in an in-vogue 3-5-2 system. He would bring all that experience to bear, helping Clint Hill and Steven Caulker keep opposition attacks at bay. Unfortunately, it just didn't work. In their first seven Premier League games of the season, QPR won one, drew one and lost five. They leaked 15 goals and the scale of their task in staying in the top division was clear. Ferdinand was demoted to the bench, Richard Dunne and Nedum Onuoha were introduced and the dye was cast for the season. His suspension for using the word 'sket' in a tweet didn't help and by the time that was served, Ferdinand was down the pecking order. Ferdinand has shown glimpses of his imperious best for QPR this season . But Ferdinand's farewell season in English football has not lived up to his expectations . Chris Ramsey has played Ferdinand on three occasions since taking over from Harry Redknapp . Queens Park Rangers find themselves two points from safety after their 3-3 draw at Aston Villa on Tuesday . As you would expect, Ferdinand has conducted himself like a model professional on the training ground, maintaining his fitness in case he was called upon. And there have been such occasions, notably the 2-0 win at Sunderland in February - Chris Ramsey's second game in charge after replacing Redknapp, that ended QPR's 11-game losing run on the road. Ferdinand may yet be called upon again in the run-in, with QPR sitting two points shy of safety, but the season so far will have fallen short of his hopes and expectations. That fairytale finale, with Ferdinand leading an heroic resistance to keep Rangers in the Premier League, seems unlikely. There are rumours that clubs in the money-soaked Qatar Stars League are preparing to tempt Ferdinand with one final payday but that remains to be seen. For now, Rio's farewell has sadly fallen a bit flat. The fixtures remaining for the bottom six in the Barclays Premier League .","Rio Ferdinand missed 3-3 thriller with Aston Villa through injury .

Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'","Stephen Munden, 54, has absconded from hospital, near Hook, Hampshire .

7711,5c0a90c2e1a54d261193c967be7c32a1d7b0de40,"A 36-year-old father in Los Angeles has been arrested and charged over the abduction of a two-year-old girl from a car wash earlier this month, who was sexually abused and then dumped in a restaurant parking lot hours later. Police say the key to tracking down the suspect, Michael David Ikeler, of Torrance, was a tip from his observant neighbor, who noticed Ikeler altering the appearance of his car. Investigators had released CCTV footage of the car - a white Nissan Altima - from the crime scene at the self-serve carwash in Gardena on April 2. The mother was washing her car when she heard the toddler scream 'Mommy', only to turn around and find her daughter gone. At the time police described the driver of the vehicle as a serial predator, KTLA reported. Predator: Michael David Ikeler, 36 - seen here in previous booking photos from 2013 - was arrested April 9 and has pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of sexual assault in relation to the abduction of a little girl . Wanted: This CCTV footage of a white Nissan Altima was the way police were able to track Ikeler down, after a neighbor saw it on the news and then noticed Ikeler trying to alter his car, which looked the same . Scene: The little was found alone and naked in this parking lot at Jim's Burgers. She was crying and had obvious injuries on her body, witnesses said . The girl, who has not been identified, was found just over two hours later in the dark parking lot of Jim's Burgers, 13 miles away, after being spotted by concerned customers next to a dumpster. She was naked, alone and had obvious injuries. Witnesses say there were scratches on her legs and that she was screaming and putting her hands over her eyes. Detectives worked around the clock to find the kidnapper responsible for the “horrific attack,” A tip came in on April 5 from a man who had seen the footage on the Nissan Altima on TV, and said his neighbor, Ikela, had been making changes to his car, which fit the description. Ikela was switching the number plates, removing the tint, and doing other cosmetic alterations like adding stickers, the neighbor said. Undercover officers began investigating. DNA evidence was gathered that linked Ikela to the horrific attack. Arrest: Undercover Gardena police officers Ikela's house in Torrance (pictured) and his car on Regina Street near 183rd Street . Father: Ikela lives with his 18-year-old daughter and also has other children. He is being held on a $1 million bond . Ikela was arrested at his home in Torrance  and charged with one count of lewd act upon a child with a kidnapping allegation, and two counts of oral copulation or sexual penetration with child 10 years old or younger, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. He entered a not guilty plea on April 13. Police have only just released the information about Ikela's arrest, saying they are doing their best to protect the family of the victim. 'I haven't seen a crime like this in the 20 years I've been in Gardena,' a police lieutenant said. 'Our detectives are so thankful to the public and the person who called us,' Gardena Police Lt. Steve Prendergrast told CBS. Ikeler has been arrested previously in Northern California and Arizona but not for crimes involving children. He also has children of his own. Neighbors say his 18-year-old daughter lives with him, and his social media accounts show more kids that appear to his as well. Investigators initially said the person responsible for the kidnapping was a serial predator. Police said Ikeler circled the car wash and as soon as the little girl wandered away, he snatched her. After the little girl was found, the frantic 911 call her mother made was released. The two-year-old girl from Gardena, California,  disappeared from this car wash on April 2 . On the 911 call, the mother can be heard saying: 'I heard a scream and then when I cam around to see her…I heard her say 'Mom' and that's when I turned around to see her washing and she was gone.' Claudia Robles, who was heading into the burger joint where the child was found around 7.15pm, said that the little girl had scratches on her legs and was afraid of going toward the male police officers. The little girl, whom Gardena police have asked not to be identified, repeatedly covered her eyes and screamed after she was found. Police, who originally said she was OK, kept mum on the extent of the girl's injuries and the extent that she had been abused, according toKTLA. The girl's mother was too distressed to speak to media. 'She's a pure little innocent baby,' her aunt Grecian Alvarez said. Police would not describe the extent of the young girl's injuries. Above, the white Nissan was also seen driving in a Gardena neighborhood . Caesar Alvarez, the girl's uncle, said that she was doing well. She was taken to St Francis Medical Center for examination.","Girl disappeared from a car wash in Gardena, California, on April 2 .

In an interview with People Magazine, the 30-year-old explained the debilitating bacterial infection is the reason behind her months-long absence from the public eye. The singer has no idea where she got the tick bite that infected her. Scroll down for video . Struggling: Avril Lavigne has revealed she has Lyme disease. She is pictured here at her 30th birthday party in Las Vegas when she was fully suffering the effects . 'I had no idea a bug bite could do this,' she said. 'I was bedridden for five months. 'I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk and I couldn't move. I thought I was dying. 'I had complete weakness and fatigue. One night I tried to brush my teeth on the tour bus and couldn't even stand.' 'There were definitely times I couldn't shower for a full week because I could barely stand,' she continued. 'It felt like having all your life sucked out of you.' Symptoms of the disease range from headaches and joint pain to severe fatigue, heart palpitations, paralysis of the face and even dementia. If not caught and treated early enough with antibiotics the condition can persist for years. Sick: The singer, seen her performing at Planet Hollywood in May, told People Magazine she had no idea where she got the tick bite that infected her . The disease was recently highlighted after Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster contracted it, who reveled she has lost the ability to read, write or even watch TV because of it. Incubation period from infection to onset of symptoms is typically two weeks, although it can be months or even years between the two, so it is impossible to say when the bites occur. Avril was between the Asian and South American world tour when she first developed symptoms . The musician thinks she may have been bitten last spring, and remembers first waking up on night in April drenched in sweat and feeling feverish. She assumed it was the flu, or even exhaustion and dehydration from touring, but when her symptoms persisted, some friends who were familiar with the disease suggested she might have it. However she said doctors were skeptical and didn't want to test her. After her last public appearance in September she tried to celebrate her 30th birthday in Las Vegas with friends, but she could not muster the energy. Awol: The Sk8er Boi singer said hubby, Nickleback frontman Chad Kroeger, helped take care of her while she was bedridden for five months . 'It was terrible, ""I could barely eat, and when we went to the pool, I had to leave and go lie in bed,' she said. 'My friends asked, ""What's wrong?"" I didn't know.' It was only several months later of, after a number of emergency room visits that a specialist finally diagnosed her. Since October the popstar holed herself up in her Ontario home while she recovers, aided by her mom who came to stay with her, while husband, Nickleback frontman Chad Kroeger took as many breaks as he could from his world tour to be with her. She says support from her fans through social media helped immensely, and she now feels around 80 per cent recovered. She now wanst to raise more awareness about the disease. Around 65,000 people in Europe are infected every year, and 25,000 Americans were diagnosed in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The tick normally has to be attached to the host for 36 hours to transfer the infection. Ill: Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Foster also suffers from the disease .

Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was working on two new versions of Google Glass, one of which was 'in preparation' Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt later appointed a new leader for the product and said that it would be 'ready for users', according to the Wall Street Journal. 'There's nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we're ending it,' he said. Vian told Luxottica shareholders that his company is 'now working on Google Glass version 2 which is in preparation'. He did not give any details about a proposed launch date for the second version. The executive has recently been to California to meet with Google's team. New versions of Google Glass, which was unveiled three years ago as a prototype available for $1,500, are thought to aim at a lower cost, longer battery life and improved sound quality. It officially offered the product to the public in 2014, though sales were low. Vian (pictured) told shareholders of his company, which makes Ray Bans, that there were 'some second thoughts' about what version three of Google Glass would be. Part of the perceived failure of the first version of the product was the mockery it generated towards 'glassholes' who wore the odd-looking gadgets. 'There are some second thoughts on how to interpret version 3' of Google Glass, Vian said, according to NDTV. Details about what the new versions will look like have not yet been released. Processor company Intel is expected to create the chip in the device.","Massimo Vian, head of Luxottica, says version two 'in preparation'

9113,7d33ecd9406866bcadf42a36b02a47decde34614,"(CNN)An Egyptian court sentenced the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie, on Saturday to death by hanging, along with 13 members of his group. The sentences will be appealed. The criminal court sentenced 36 other defendants to life in prison on charges of plotting terrorist attacks against state facilities. They faced charges that include ""funding the Rabaa al-Adawiya sit-in"" -- a mass protest in Cairo in August 2013 that was forcibly dispersed by security personnel -- and spreading ""false information"" to destabilize Egypt. They were arrested in a sweeping crackdown on supporters of former President Mohamed Morsy, the country's first democratically elected president, who was overthrown in 2013 in a military coup that bitterly split Egyptians. One of those sentenced to life in prison was Mohamad Soltan, a 27-year-old U.S.-Egyptian activist. He has been languishing in Cairo's notorious Tora Prison, where he has been on a hunger strike for more than 14 months. The U.S. State Department released a statement condemning Soltan's sentence and calling for his release on humanitarian grounds. The presiding judge for Badie, Soltan and the other defendants was Mohamed Nagy Shehata, who is known for his harsh verdicts. Shehata has sentenced more than 180 people to death and was the original judge in a high-profile case case involving Al Jazeera journalists. Badie had been sentenced to death before on a conviction related to a deadly attack on a police station. He has also been sentenced to life in prison for inciting violence during 2013's unrest. The Egyptian news outlet Al Ahram reported that Badie had been sentenced to death twice before, but an appeals court overturned one verdict, and Egypt's Grand Mufti disapproved of the other. During the summer of unrest, hundreds of people died when the police forcefully cleared camps set up by protesting Morsy supporters and when security forces opened fire on Morsy backers who attacked police stations, government buildings and churches. The government accused the protesters of inciting violence. After the coup, the new government outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood. Morsy was arrested, and he too faces trial. Soltan's sister, Hanaa, is anxious about what the future holds for her family. She wrote a letter to her brother expressing her feelings. ""Dear Mohamed,"" the letter read. ""I'm often asked why, and how, you've kept up your hunger strike for 14 months now, despite our pleas for you to end it. I've watched your body go from a plump basketball-playing frame to one that has withered down to its bones. ""Your face, with its beautiful smile often grinning, now looks permanently in pain. And, all I can do to explain is to tell people that it's the only form of control you have to hold on to -- now more than ever, on the eve of your sentencing."" CNN's Don Melvin contributed to this report.","The death sentences will be appealed .

2512,3e12c24eea045adc0a4fa74a917b4beb0d5ba364,"Star Wars: Rogue One, starring Felicity Jones, which is slated for release in December 2016 . The Jedis are all but extinct, the Old Republic is in turmoil and the threat of the Death Star is looming in 'Rogue One,' fans learned at Star Wars Celebration on Sunday. Gareth Edwards who directed Godzilla debuted a tantalizing trailer to preview the mysterious film, which is part of a series of films exploring other stories outside of the core 'Star Wars' saga. 'For more than 1,000 generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times. Before the Empire,' says Alec Guinness as Obi Wan Kenobi in a voiceover reprised from 1977's Star Wars: A New Hope. While the ominous words so familiar to millions fans are delivered the camera tracks to show a ghostly Death Star hovering in the clouds. At the screening, audience members were heard to gasp when Guinness spoke and then whoop when the Death Star came into view. Set chronologically between the third and the fourth movies in the 'Star Wars' saga, the film will follow a band of resistance fighters who unite to steal the Death Star plans and 'bring a new hope,' referring to the subtitle of the original 'Star Wars.' At the same time, the iconic franchise's Twitter account posted a capsule of the storyline, saying: 'A band of resistance fighters unite for a daring mission to steal the Death Star plans in Star Wars anthology film, Rogue One #RogueOne. Preview: Fans at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, California were able to view a preview of the first Star Wars spin-of entitled Rogue One . More to come: The Star Wars website released this Twitter describing the storyline for the film, which is described as an anthology movie adding to the Star Wars universe . December 2016: The film is set after Episode III and before Episode IV, added director Gareth Edwards added that his film won't have clear-cut villains and heroes . Felicity Jones, who recently garnered an Oscar nomination for her role in 'The Theory of Everything' is the only confirmed cast member for the film, which will shoot in London this summer for a December 2016 release. Jones will play a rebel soldier, the director said. Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy appears on the Cantina set at Star Wars Celebration: The Ultimate Fan Experience held in Anaheim last week . Edwards said that her character will not just be a stoic soldier, but a complex, fully rounded human. 'We wanted to see fear, warmth, all of those aspects that everybody has,' he said, excited that Jones embodies 'the complete package.' In the world of 'Rogue One,' Edwards said the 'absence of Jedi is omnipresent.' The characters in the film realize that the 'gods are not coming to save us,' he said. 'It comes down to a group of people who don't have magical powers who band together to bring hope to the galaxy.' 'Cinderella' scribe Chis Weitz wrote the screenplay based on an idea from visual effects supervisor John Knoll. Josh Trank, who is set to direct the next, still untitled 'Star Wars' anthology film, did not attend the event although he was originally scheduled to appear. The idea for the film came from award-winning visual effects artist John Knoll, who pitched the idea internally before bringing it to Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm's Kiri Hart. Hart, vice president of development for Lucasfilm, said that the anthology films will vary in 'scale and genre.' She added that they are describing them as 'anthology films' that expand the Star Wars universe without necessarily using the main characters. 'We wanted freedom to do some films that would be able to stand on their own and tell unique stories,' she said. 'They can still feel like `Star Wars' and be `Star Wars.' Talented: The upcoming standalone movie will be directed by Gareth Edwards of 'Godzilla' fame . Coming soon: Rogue One starts shooting this summer, and will be released in December of 2016 .","Rogue One will be a prequel to the original trilogy .

The US Geological Survey said in a preliminary report that the quake with a depth of about five miles happened just before 9pm last night, according to the Associated Press. It was centered about four miles north of San Fernando near Interstate 210. The epicentre of the quake was around four miles north of San Fernando near Interstate 210, according to the US Geological Survey . The earthquake caused a 'sharp jolt' to be felt in the San Fernando Valley (pictured) north of Los Angeles . The jolt was felt widely in the San Fernando Valley and parts of northern Los Angeles County. There was no reported damage or injuries and police and fire departments say there were no problems reported. The quake came three days after a magnitude 3.5 earthquake hit the west Los Angeles neighborhood of Baldwin Hills. It happened around 9.17pm and reverberated across the city. Residents on social media described it as a 'quick jolt'. Earlier in the day at 4.35pm a smaller 2.5 magnitude quake hit the same area. That quake was initially reported as a 2.9 magnitude tremor, but was later downgraded by the US Geological Survey. There were no reports of injuries or damages from either incident. Los Angelenos are used to such small tremors, due to the city's positioning on several fault lines.","US Geological Survey said quake just before 9pm had depth of five miles .

10427,e76615c98ff22e65662dec97d7a48a7cc57d831d,"A few blocks from the finish line and even closer to the spot where the second bomb exploded during the 2013 Boston Marathon, race organizers are building a combination clubhouse, interactive museum and retail store that, for the first time, gives them a year-round, public presence. The Boston RunBase scheduled to open April 16 will allow visitors to learn about the world's most prestigious road race, run a replica of the course on a treadmill or see artifacts from its 118-year history. It will give runners a place to gather before going for a jog by the Charles River, and then shower and change before heading back to work or to the convention center across the street. Construction: Joe Clifford paints the ceiling of RunBase near the 26-mile mark of the Boston Marathon, in Boston on Wednesday . Champion: A gold laurel wreath, which is awarded to the winner of the Boston Marathon, is displayed at the Boston Athletic Association. The wreath, and other historic items from the race, will be on display when RunBase opens later in April . Location: RunBase is just a few blocks from the marathon finish line, and even nearer to the spot where the second bomb exploded during the 2013 race. Runners are seen here during the 2013 Boston Marathon . If they want to pick up a pair of shoes or a Boston Marathon jacket, they can do that, too. 'This RunBase is the front door,' Tom Grilk, the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, said this week before checking in on the construction at the Boylston Street storefront. 'It is intended to be a place where the visitor can touch the history, the tradition of the Boston Marathon, and then get out and do something, go for a run themselves.' A combined effort between the B.A.A., Adidas and longtime shoe-seller Marathon Sports, which is providing the staff and retail know-how, the Boston RunBase is a shoeseum of sorts: part shoe store, part museum. It is the sixth RunBase for Adidas 0 the first in the U.S. But it will differ from locations from Tokyo to Prague, as well as the Nike store nearby, because of its association with the Boston Marathon. 'Not only is the Boston Marathon the Carnegie Hall of running, but Boston is an amazing running community,' said Mikal Peveto, Adidas' director of running innovation. And that became even more apparent after two bombs interrupted the 2013 race, attacks that galvanized runners and turned the Boston Marathon into a symbol of the city's resilience. 'It drew the global running community together over something that's kind of ours, as runners,' Peveto said. 'It changed everything. From something so tragic, it was incredibly powerful what came out of that ... realizing that we had something even more special than we had before.' A running club that had long been associated primarily with its flagship race, the B.A.A. had spent the last 15 years expanding its calendar to include a half-marathon in the fall and a 5K and 10K in the spring and summer. But the organization remained tucked away a few blocks from the course in offices decorated with memorabilia that can be seen, Grilk said, by 'essentially nobody.' Down the street: Boylston Street, the site of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing - as well as the finish line for the marathon itself - is now how to a Boston Marathon-themed store and clubhouse . Legacy: A cyclist pedals over the  finish line of the Boston Marathon on Wednesday. Year-round visitors to Boston have had limited options to learn the history of the race, besides visiting the course, until this month when RunBase opens . Leader: Tom Grilk, the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, smiles during an interview regarding RunBase . 'We thought: Why not take all this stuff and bring it out to the street?' he said. 'If you can be engaged with the community, you have a chance. You may still screw things up, but you have a chance. Otherwise, you're just the guys who are stopping traffic.' The B.A.A. plans to use the RunBase for special events, including clinics and meet-ups where recreational joggers can connect or get tips from coaches before heading out on a run. Lockers and showers will save them a trip home to change; those staying at one of the Back Bay's dozens of hotels might be sent by the front desk to find a running partner or a good route for, say, a leisurely 5K. The site is about one block after marathon runners turn off of Hereford Street for the final stretch to the finish line, not far from the Charles River Esplanade that is one of the city's prettiest backdrops for a run. It is across the street from the Hynes Convention Center, which hosts a shoulder-to-shoulder runners' expo on marathon weekend and events throughout the year. 'For me, it doesn't matter if it's a dental convention or a running convention,' Peveto said. 'Right outside on Boylston Street, when they walk outside, they're going to see that RunBase.' Much of the memorabilia had been on display in the B.A.A. offices. Other items, like the sweatshirt Kathrine Switzer wore when she became the first woman to enter the race — and when a race official tried to bodily remove her from the course — were locked away in drawers. Now they will be included in rotating exhibits, along with records of every Boston Marathon competitor in one place for the first time. 'You could go in there and say, ""Hey, my dad ran this in 1972."" And click, click, click, you could look up your dad,' Peveto said. Said B.A.A. spokesman Jack Fleming: 'This will be our Ellis Island.' 'When someone participates in the Boston Marathon, they feel like they are added to the honor roll. It's almost like being a part of an alumni association: You just have that connection with the people that have preceded you,' he said. 'And you know that you are following, literally, in their footsteps.'","The Boston RunBase is scheduled to open April 16 .

The 33-year-old, who is vying for a place on Team GB at the Rio Olympics, welcomed Mia Grace with husband Mike Tindall last year. But after finding herself 'surprised' by how her fitness dropped during pregnancy, the Queen's granddaughter has committed to a strict exercise and diet regime to get back in shape. Scroll down for video . Zara Phillips has told of how she was surprised at how difficult it was to regain her fitness after the birth of her daughter, Mia, one (pictured left in January and right, last July when Mia was six months old) 'What surprised me about having a baby is losing all your fitness and how tough it is to get it back to that level again,' she said in an interview with The Sunday Time Magazine. Starting her morning at 7am, Zara has a breakfast of Greek yogurt and honey and tries to get in a stint on the exercise bike at her home, Gatcombe Park, before Mia wakes at 8am. Her day is then typically spent with the horses kept at her mother, Princess Anne's stables, before squeezing in another workout. 'Lunch is quick and simple, like soup and a sandwich or eggs and toast. I don't diet but I try to eat well and not to eat too many carbohydrates or sugary things.

But the question went viral after people across the world were left completely baffled. The problem, which tests logical reasoning, has been shared thousands of times online as people have tried to pose their best explanations of what at first appears to be an impossible question. A maths question set for 14-year-olds has left people across the world baffled as they try to solve the puzzle . The test was set for 14-year-olds in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. The Olympiad often features logical reasoning questions and are set to test top achievers. Katie Chrystler tweeted: 'If Cheryl makes it this hard to find out when her birthday is, she's NOT going to get many gifts.' David Leong joked: 'Cheryl obviously didn't want Albert and Bernard at her party. Should have taken the hint when Cheryl decided to play this little game.' One man in London said: 'I did not have a bleeding clue! I wish I were as clever to answer something like this. But my brain just doesn't work like that.' The test asked: . Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates. May 15, May 16,  May 19 . June 17, June 18 . July 14, July 16 . August 14, August 15, August 17 . Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively. Albert: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too. Bernard: At first I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now. Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is. So when is Cheryl's birthday? Organisers of SASMO said the question was set to filter out the most intelligent of participants . At first the question appears impossible to answer without a bit of extra information, but we know Cheryl has already told Albert the month of her birthday, and Bernard the day. Each of the men does not know what the other has been told. This allows reasoning to be used to begin to whittle down the number of options. So, firstly, for Albert to be 'certain' that Bernard cannot know the answer - as suggested in the first statement he makes - we can deduct that the birthday is not in May or June. This is because in the months of May and June there are numbers (dates) that only occur once across the four months - namely May 19 and June 18. If Albert had been given May or June as the month, there is no way he could be certain that Bernard doesn't know the birthday. Bernard, after all, might have been the number 18 or 19. For Albert to be 'certain' that Bernard doesn't know, Albert must have been given a month that does not contain one of these 'unique' dates - i.e. July or August. Albert's disclosure now gives Bernard the clue he needs, and says he now knows the birthday. Bernard only knows the number of Cheryl's birthday, but from Albert's statement he has now also ruled out both May and June. This is because he realises Albert has ruled out May and June because of the 'single number' aspect above. So there are now just five remaining dates - July 14, July 16, Aug 14, Aug 15, Aug 17 - and Bernard says he knows which is the birthday. Because he now knows the date, we can whittle it down further to three dates by ruling out the numbers that appear in duplicate. At first, the question appears impossible top answer without more information, but here's how to work it out . If Cheryl had told Bernard that her birthday fell on the 14th of the month, then he could not have worked out the date at this stage. However, as he states that he now knows the date, we can rule out July 14 or August 14. This leaves just three dates to chose from - July 16, Aug 15 and Aug 17. Following Bernard's statement, Albert is then apparently able to deduce the date of Cheryl's birthday. This means her birthday must be the only remaining date in the month he was originally told. Given that there are two dates left in August and one in July, it has to be the July date. So the answer is July 16. The problem was posted on Facebook by 'Hello Singapore' television presenter Kenneth Kong, and went viral as people posted their various solutions to the problem. It was set for 14-year-olds in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiads (SASMO), which were held on April 8. This year around 28,000 students from countries across the world including Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, China and the UK took the test. Henry Ong, executive director of SASMO, told Mothership.sg: 'Being Q24 out of 25 questions, this is a difficult question meant to sift out the better students. SASMO contests target the top 40% of the student population and the standards of most questions are just high enough to stretch the students.' Of course, perhaps the more important question is whether Cheryl deserves a birthday gift at all after putting us through all of this.","A maths problem for 14-year-olds has baffled people across the world .

8003,a5e9c4440c4dd8a2fa3ab9620df7db85c216ee8d,"(CNN)Recently, Robert Kennedy Jr. was in Sacramento, California, to campaign against Senate Bill 227, which makes it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinations. In his remarks at an anti-vaccination movie screening, he decided to compare ""vaccine-induced"" autism to the Holocaust. He said, ""They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,"" Kennedy said. ""This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country."" A few days later, he apologized to people who were outraged on behalf of the memory of the Holocaust. To many, it's sacrilege to compare any lesser issue to the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis. In a statement, Kennedy said, ""I want to apologize to all whom I offended by my use of the word to describe the autism epidemic. I employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism, which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families."" Robert Kennedy Jr. has apologized for the wrong things. First and foremost, vaccines do not cause autism. The two have nothing to do with each other. Second, he seems to think people with autism are ""gone,"" their lives ""destroyed"" and their families ""shattered."" Autism is not a death sentence. People with autism are not missing or destroyed. They are everywhere, trying to live their lives in a society that too often demeans them as subhuman, missing or worthless. Kennedy's rhetoric is a problem, even beyond the fraudulent basis for his claims about vaccines. People who believe autism is an environmental disease try to cure kids with quack treatments like giving them bleach-based enemas. Others, believing autism functions as a death sentence, even kill their children. I am worried about the effect of having such a powerful, high-profile member of our political class endorse this demeaning depiction of life with autism. I reached out to a number of autistic activists for comment. Ari Ne'eman, president of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, wrote, ""Robert Kennedy Jr, who has engaged with autism only to spread lies, misinformation and dehumanizing rhetoric, has never meaningfully engaged in efforts to improve the lives of autistic Americans. While his father, uncle and many others in the Kennedy-Shriver family championed the rights of people with disabilities, he has instead cast his lot with those who use pseudo-science to question our humanity."" These are harsh words, but try to see the situation through Ne'eman's eyes. Not only is Kennedy perpetuating a discredited theory, but he's also suggesting that it's better to let your children get preventable and sometimes fatal diseases than risk becoming autistic. The usual response to people like Ne'eman is that he is ""high functioning,"" but what of the burden to families who are struggling to care for less able individuals? Henry Frost, an autistic teenager and writer, is devastated by this focus on burden. Last year, he wrote a post to other autistic children: ""Know you are not a burden or trouble for being. You are a person who has every right to be. A family that is saying love but saying you are so hard so wrong for not being as they wanted. The family is wrong. Not You."" Meanwhile, Amy Sequenzia, an autistic activist and blogger, wrote, ""I am very disabled, have most of the usual not autism but co-occurring conditions, seizures almost every day, but am happy, proud and accomplished, with the human supports I have. That's what is missing. Acceptance."" As children, Sequenzia and Frost might well have been just the kinds of people labeled as ""gone,"" by Kennedy. Clearly, both are very much present. The solution lies in understanding autism and related conditions as part of human diversity. Michael S. Monje Jr., an autistic writer and editor with Autonomous Press, wrote, ""The neurodiversity movement is a direct counter to this kind of attitude. It is a way for autistic people, as well as anyone else who experiences the world differently due to their neurology, to assert that these natural divergences in human development are just that -- natural. The fact that they are largely unsupported by our society as it is currently configured does not make them in any way less natural, less worthy, or less beautiful than other ways of being in the world."" I wish Kennedy realized how much his apology demeaned people with intellectual disabilities, even as he defended the sacred status of the Holocaust. There is, though, one story from the Holocaust that he might do well to consider. The first group the Nazis systematically exterminated, in the infamous Action T4, were people with intellectual and other kinds of disabilities.  Thousands of children, adolescents and adults were sent to gas chambers, laying the groundwork for the later, larger scale acts of genocide. Underlying Action T4 was the belief that people with disabilities were devoid of value. We fight those beliefs by celebrating neurodiversity, not by fearmongering. Kennedy owes a lot of people another apology.","David Perry: Robert Kennedy Jr. compared autism to the Holocaust, wrongly tied it to vaccines .
He says it's sad such a prominent Kennedy demeans people with autism .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11403,72ca1a74a574c23c6c92b78eb52d440e5831de7d,"At the Ballon d'Or ceremony in January Carlo Ancelotti and Diego Simeone were runners-up as Joachim Low won the best coach award for guiding Germany to the World Cup. As the two men small-talked in Zurich, Simeone is understood to have asked Ancelotti how life was in Madrid and his answer demonstrated perfectly the dynamic between the two men. He said he was happy in the city and keen to stay, but that life would be a lot easier if Simeone were not on the other side of town managing Atletico Madrid. Having already lost the Spanish Super Cup to Simeone at the start of the season, and the first league meeting between the two teams, since the FIFA gala Ancelotti has been knocked out of the Copa del Rey by his nemesis and beaten 4-0 in the league. The pressure is on Carlo Ancelotti and Real Madrid when Atletico Madrid visit the Bernabeu on Sunday . Ancelotti reportedly told Diego Simeone that life in Madrid would be a lot easier if Atletico weren't around . Simeone (left) and Ancelotti (right) were runners-up behind Joachim Low at the Ballon d'Or in January . 'We don't need to beat them, we just need to go through' was how he approached the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final. That would have been fine had Real marked-up a high-scoring draw in the Calderon but the 0-0 somehow scraped by Atletico Madrid last Tuesday means that now a draw will not send Real Madrid through. Carlo needs to beat Diego – or else it's either elimination or penalties. Ancelotti's overall record against Simeone is poor with just three wins in 12 games. He has been beaten twice by his team in the league this season, losing one and drawing one in the domestic competition last season. He did win both legs of a Copa del Rey tie last season but this season Atletico got their cup revenge with an away draw and a home win to knock Real out. Atletico also won the Spanish Super Cup in August. The overall record is 12 played, three won, four drawn and five lost. The games are tight, usually low scoring and uncomfortably physical for Real who, Sergio Ramos and Pepe aside, are short of players who have quite the same appetite for a battle. Ancelotti may well pick both on Wednesday night, and a third centre back in Rafael Varane as he looks to match the visitors for force. If all three are picked Pepe would step into a midfield enforcer's role that he has not occupied since the days of Jose Mourinho. Real Madrid have struggled against Atletico in recent years and were beaten 4-0 in La Liga in February . The headlines from Spanish publications AS and Marca on Wednesday focused on the huge derby game . The Champions League quarter-final first leg finished 0-0 after a physical game at the Vicente Calderon . There are seven players who a booking away from missing the first leg of the semi-final and German midfielder Toni Kroos, who is among them, has already lit the blue touch paper suggesting Atletico Madrid's players are experts in pressuring the referee. The question of what will happen to Ancelotti if he loses has already been extensively debated in Madrid. It wouldn't necessarily be the end of him but he would certainly have to overhaul Barcelona's two point advantage in the league – winning nothing would be grounds for automatic dismissal regardless of the Champions League he delivered last season. At times this season his team has looked like surpassing the exploits of last year's campaign – the run of 22 straight wins that also saw them crowned World Club champions in December in Malaysia was the stuff of future legend but the season collapsed in February and the bouquets for the Italian turned into brickbats overnight. Toni Kroos is a yellow card away from European suspension while Ancelotti has several players missing . The Italian coach watches his players, including Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) train in Madrid on Monday . Injuries played their part in the massive downturn. Sergio Ramos and Pepe were missing from defence and Luka Modric and James Rodriguez from midfield. Supporters bemoaned the fact that Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema should still have been able to carry the team to victories but that view did a huge disservice to the way Modric controls games, Rodriguez loads the bullets for the front three to fire, and Pepe and Ramos' pace enables the team to play ten yards higher up the pitch than when they are not available. Just when it seemed Real would be at full-strength for the run-in Modric has gone down with knee ligament trouble likely to rule him out for six weeks and Benzema, Bale and Marcelo are also all missing on Wednesday night. Ancelotti resisted the opportunity to get his excuses in early on Tuesday when he said he had the 'best squad in the world'. He will hope that message of confidence inspires his players at the Bernabeu. And of course in among all the bad omens there is one exceptionally positive precedent: in Lisbon last May, Madrid beat Atletico Madrid 4-1 and lifted the European Cup. If Ancelotti and Real were to lose on Wednesday night then only La Liga glory would be enough to save his job . Cristiano Ronaldo struck in the Champions League final in a rare 4-1 victory for Real against their city rivals .","Real Madrid host Atletico in Champions League quarter-final second leg .

2130,c1db130d946d3c961edbaf9983c1ecb5e69629b8,"An NFL defensive back with a history of legal problems is being investigated after reports of an early-morning incident involving a physical fight and at least one shot being fired at a Texas club. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother are being investigated for aggravated assault after an altercation at a Dallas-area nightclub on Wednesday morning, according to reports. During a 2011 incident involving two guns when he playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Talib and his mother were accused of shooting a gun at his sister's live-in boyfriend in Garland, Texas. Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and his brother Yaqub are being investigated for aggravated assault . Talib was in trouble before and was wanted on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 2011 . During the latest incident, a shot was fired outside of Club Luxx in Dallas, Texas, after a physical fight inside . During the incident on Wednesday, Talib and his brother Yaqub had a physical altercation with someone inside Club Luxx and then a shot was fired outside around 2am, WFAA reported. When Dallas officers responded to the active shooter call, the man who called police said three black men had been involved in a disturbance and one of them had tried to punch him. The man also said one of the men pulled out a gun and aimed it at him before firing a round off into the sky outside the bar and causing 'an immediate panic'. The Talibs left the area in a Range Rover and a Jaguar and went to the XTC Cabaret. Police found the brothers at the second club and impounded the vehicles to look for evidence. The brothers were both questioned and an investigation into the incident is ongoing. The general manager of Club Luxx, confirmed the Talibs were at the club but denied that anything with a gun transpired, the Dallas Morning News reported. Hanney Kamal said: 'One-hundred percent that did not happen. 'I was there. Somebody might have called the police because there was a yelling argument. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract last year . 'It's athletes — someone sees them yelling and dials 911. 'Everyone was asked to leave the club, which they did of their own free will, and that was it.' Broncos vice president of public relations Patrick Smyth said: 'We have been in touch with Aqib regarding these reports and will continue to monitor this situation.' Dallas police falsely reported Talib had been arrested for throwing bottles last June during an NFL camp afterparty, the Denver Post reported. The police apologized after it ended up being Yaqub who was arrested. During the 2011 incident in Garland, felony warrants were issued for Talib and his mother Okolo Talib on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police suspected them both of firing shots from a Ruger .380 handgun at Shannon Billings, the boyfriend of Talib's sister, and also believed the NFL back attempted to pistol-whip Billings with a Springfield 9mm semiautomatic handgun during the incident, the Boston Globe reported. They had apparently learned Billings was being physically abusive towards their family member. Talib, who owned both weapons. reportedly yelled during the pistol-whipping: 'You're going to make me throw away my career.' The charges were dropped because prosecutors believed Billings, a registered sex offender with the state of Texas, would not make a credible witness. Garland Police spokesman Joe Harn said: 'It was very fortunate no one was killed and no one was hurt seriously. 'There wasn't a great deal of distance from one person to the other that was shooting.' After the 2011 incident, a felony warrant was issued for  Okolo Talib for an assault with a deadly weapon charge . In addition to playing for the Broncos, Talib has also played for the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Bucs . In addition to the gun incidents, Talib was investigated after an alleged assault on a Florida cab driver. He then resisted arrest on charges of simple battery. The shutdown corner also fought with teammates and was suspended for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Talib signed a six-year, $57 million contract with Denver in March 2014. He also has played for the New England Patriots during his seven-year career. During his time with the reigning Super Bowl champs, Talib said: 'I'm a competitor on the field, man. 'That's kind of what we're talking about right now, just football.' If charges are brought with regard to the incident in Dallas, Talib could face discipline under the NFL's personal conduct policy and a suspension seems possible given his history.

In the Australian outback, if you want to get up-close and personal with a mob of local Emus, you need a guide who will get down and dirty ... apparently. In a video posted online by YouTube user Ratbag Nomad, one man, referred to as Australianwidefishingguide, shows tourists how it's done. Emus are notoriously curious flightless birds of Australia . As the tour guide started peddling his legs slowly in the air, the mob of emus started coming closer . And closer . The video, filmed from a vehicle on an empty dirt road in the bush, shows the guide lying down on his back and kicking his legs in the air to lure a mob of emus in the distance. Peddling his legs to the sky, he looks like something between  an up-side down bicycle rider and a dead cockroach. Sure enough, the Emus - known to be especially curious birds - come close to see what's going on, then scatter as the guide leaps to his feat. A good leg in the air does the trick . As the guide leapt to his feet, the inquisitive birds scattered . It's thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - whose meat was highly valued for its oils. Emus belong to the same family of flightless birds as the ostrich and the cassowary. Capable of reaching running speeds of up to 70 km/hour, they're said to be able to 'run the pants off a Kangaroo.'

She said: 'I hate the gym. Who doesn't? When I'm in the gym I feel like I am missing out. I would rather rent a bike or go for a hike.'

A source revealed that she had been eating plenty of lean proteins like turkey, chicken and venison to shed the baby weight. Despite her envy-inducing figure, Blake admitted that she has insecure days just like everyone else. She admitted: 'Some days I look in the mirror and think, ""Oh my gosh. I look like a potato."" You think that I would never feel bad about myself? I'm a human being - everybody has their insecurities. 'Ask Gisele [Bündchen] or Beyoncé. They will tell you that some days, they don't feel good about themselves.'

She told the host: 'It's a family name, and I liked having a boy's name.' Blake also revealed  that if she had one piece of advice for her beloved daughter, it would be, 'don't let anyone tell you no.' The 27-year-old actress also jokingly shared with host Jimmy Fallon that her 38-year-old spouse is 'pathetic' at parenting even revealing: 'I do everything, he does nothing!' At the Reynolds' household, the first-time parents currently have a bit of a competition regarding their only child. 'We're total rivals,' she shared explaining that she and Ryan are trying hard to teach little James to say her first word of 'dada' or 'mama.' 'Dada is banned in our house!' Blake admitted.

After enduring an incredible 14 years of chemotherapy and radiation, the mother of two lost her battle to cancer last Thursday morning at an Adelaide nursing home at the age of 61. But four days before she died, her husband Ronny and their two daughters Symantha, 40, and Kelly, 38, noticed her  ring was missing from her finger. 'Dad  noticed the bruises around her finger and asked us if we managed to get the ring off,' Symantha told Daily Mail Australia. 'Three weeks prior to her passing, we tried to remove the ring because it started to cut her circulation but we had no luck after trying everything we could think of.' The family has launched a desperate online appeal in a bid to have their mother's ring returned. Christine Davidson (left) who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, pictured with her husband Ronny (right) and their daughter Symantha (centre) Christine and her husband Ronny were happily married for 41 years before she passed away . Kelly took to her Facebook account last Wednesday to post an emotional appeal and has since attracted more than 117,000 shares and almost 17,000 likes. 'We just don't understand how someone could steal from a dying woman,' Symantha said. 'The ring was a sign of mum and dad's long lasting love and their strong marriage – they were happily married for 41 years before she passed. 'Mum also promised to give the ring to her only granddaughter who she was very close to - My daughter Jayda, 17, but now she's devastated.' Christine was working at an insurance company before her sickness came on suddenly 14 years ago . Christine, who fell suddenly ill 14 years ago, pictured with her grandchildren last Christmas . On March 28, the family was told their mother, grandmother and wife was on her 'final stage of life'. 'She was a nanna to four amazing grandchildren and she was the best mum we could ever ask for,' Symantha said. 'The last 14 years was hard on our family because we were forced to watch her suffer but we're happy she's at peace now and she's not in pain anymore. 'Multiple neurosurgeons were blown away with what she had accomplished after she fought hard to kick the rare long-lasting tumour - she was a brave fighter.' Christine was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and was told she only had up to three years to live . Symantha said she has informed the police about the missing ring. Daily Mail Australia has contacted South Australian police for comment. Christine lived at the retirement home, which the family has asked Daily Mail Australia to keep anonymous, for more than four years. 'The majority of the nurses were fantastic and mum was cared for very well,' Kelly said. Jewellery store SA Gold Diggers in Salisbury, South Australia has offered a $1000 reward for anyone providing information that leads to finding the missing ring. 'The generosity and kindness of people everywhere has absolutely blown us away,' Symantha said.

1541,71cfa34d7c8d2acd4244817fe963343b12e51928,"The Duchess of Cambridge is a modern-day suffragette who has done more to advance the cause of women than anyone else in recent years. Or so says actress Patsy Kensit, who made the comments in an interview with this week's Stylist magazine. Miss Kensit, 47, appeared in the magazine's regular 'Queen of Everything' feature and said the Duchess of Cambridge would be her 'regal inspiration'. Feminist icon: Patsy Kensit says the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette' Charity work: The Duchess is famous for philanthropy but not, until now, feminism . She added: 'She's so fabulous on every level. She repeats outfits, which is brilliant. I know it's a shallow thing to say but I think it's done so much for women. 'I'm not going to be forced to have to look different every time I go out. She's like our generation's suffragette.' This is the first time that the Duchess, who spends much of her time doing charity work, has been lauded as a feminist icon. Although she has won plaudits for her dedication to children's charities such as The Art Room and Place2Be, her demure dress sense and closeness to her family has resulted in some criticism. Most recently, novelist Margaret Atwood revealed that she thinks Kate is an 'uneventful dresser' who is no match for Princess Diana. Suffragette: Emily Wilding Davison is pictured throwing herself in front of the King's horse in 1913 . Votes for women: Campaigners lobbying for votes for women became known as suffragettes . Critics: The Duchess was dubbed a 'machine made princess' by Hilary Mantel and 'drab' by Margaret Atwood . 'I think she's watching her back,' continued the 75-year-old author. 'I think she probably has people who pretty much tell her what is appropriate for her to wear. 'I don't think she's become the fashion plate that Diana was, and I think she's probably doing that advisably, wouldn't you say?' Miss Atwood isn't the only writer to criticise the Duchess, who is due to give birth to her second child later this month, in public. Double Booker Prize winner and Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel has described Kate as being like a 'shop window mannequin' and a 'machine-made' princess who has been 'designed by committee'. Meanwhile Sandi Toksvig caused outrage when she said the Duchess doesn't have a 'single opinion' of her own, while Joan Smith produced a similar storm by labelling Kate 'unambitious and bland'.","Miss Kensit said the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette'

In a dig at the Prime Minister, the Ukip leader said that he was 'jealous' of how the Tory leader has reversed the greying process while in Downing Street. After clashing at last week's televised leaders debate, Mr Farage said he had shaken Mr Cameron's hand and 'complimented him on his appearance'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron - who has been accused of trying to hide his bald spot - has been secretly using hair dye to turn back the years, Nigel Farage suggested today . He added: 'Any man who can reverse the greying process I'm jealous of. 'I'm going to have a go myself, it's a wonderful thing. He's also lost a lot of weight, he's going out jogging.' Asked if he thought Mr Cameron was too vain, Mr Farage said: 'To a certain extent they all are. Some people it worries to death and others really don't worry too much.' Mr Cameron, 48, has previously been accused of visiting stylists and even trichologists to keep his hair looking youthful. In 2011, Downing Street was forced to deny claims Mr Cameron was fighting the relentless process with unnatural help after his grey hairs looked less prominent, . 'I promise you he has not dyed his hair,' a spokesman said. 'The Prime Minister has other things to think about, he's just not like that.' Mr Farage said he was 'jealous' of how the Tory leader has reversed the greying process while in Downing Street .

'I've had a few grey hairs and I expect I'll get a few more, whatever happens. This is a relentless process,' he said.

2989,1a2c1d5f2e0c5887373040773d825e50d2c73b57,"US authorities suspected that a British man accused this week of causing the 2010 'flash crash' was making illicit trades back in 2009 it's been revealed, with experts expressing shock that it took six years for charges to be brought. Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, is accused of making £26million from illegal trades over five years and an investigation team involving six agencies in the US and Britain want him put on trial in New York. But analysts are bewildered that it's taken this long for action to be taken. US authorities suspected that British man Navinder Singh Sarao (circled) accused this week of causing the 2010 'flash crash' was making illicit trades back in 2009 . US prosecutors believe Mr Sarao used special computer software to manipulate the market on Wall Street . 'Flash crash': Sarao is accused of causing the Wall Street 'Flash Crash' on May 6, 2010, when £570billion ($850 billion) was wiped from the value of America's biggest companies in five minutes . Sarao was warned about his trading in 2009 by officials at the self-regulatory Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where he was making transactions. However, he continued his alleged manipulation well into this year. Dave Lauer, president of lobbying and research firm Kor Group, told Bloomberg that he was gobsmacked at the pace of the investigation. He said: 'How this continued for six years when the CME appeared to know about it, it kind of boggles my mind. This is about as simple and easy as you can get, and it took them this long to do anything about it.' Edgar Perez, author of Knightmare on Wall Street and The Speed Traders, meanwhile, asked: 'Why would regulators let Sarao operate in the markets and engage in similar trading strategies as in the Flash Crash eight more times?' Sarao allegedly triggered – from his home computer in Hounslow, London – the Wall Street 'Flash Crash' of May 2010, in which almost a trillion dollars was wiped from global share prices, using a series of fake transactions. Trader Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, is shown here at Westminster Magistrates' Court after being arrested over illicit trading . A flash crash is a sudden plunge in stock prices. On May 6, 2010, the US stock market dramatically collapsed – wiping billions off the world's biggest companies. Between 2.42pm and 2.47pm, the Dow Jones shed 600 points, having already been down more than 300 points – a startling 6 per cent fall in just five minutes. Very soon it had recorded an almost 1,000-point loss on the day. But, by 3.07pm, the market had miraculously regained most of the 600-point drop – making the flash crash the second-largest point swing ever recorded. Hours later, European markets opened and crashed in similar fashion. The UK's FTSE 100 fell 138 points, France's Cac shed 163 points, and Germany's Dax dropped 193 points. The cause of the crash puzzled US officials. Theories included technical glitches, high frequency trading or changes in market structure – but never criminal activity. He allegedly used automated trading software to 'spoof' the market by placing up to 19,000 orders and then cancelling them, all in under one second. However, manipulation wasn't identified as the cause of the crash in a September 2010 report, suggesting that regulators did not see his activity at that time. Tim Massad, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the trading of futures and swaps, said on Wednesday that it took so long to charge Sarao because of the size and complexity of U.S. derivatives markets. 'These are huge markets,' he said. 'There's a lot going on.' The agency, which oversees self-regulatory bodies such as the CME, brought civil charges against Sarao alongside criminal charges by the Department of Justice. The many years it took for the CFTC to come out with its findings, and the fact that manipulation wasn't mentioned in the 2010 report, suggested that the help of a whistleblower was essential in bringing the charges, one lawyer said. 'This can't have been a five-year continuous investigation, can't have been,' said the lawyer, who is familiar with the CFTC's thinking, and who asked to remain anonymous. 'Something happened some period later where this came up again. 'If there was any indication that there was manipulation behind this, given the profile of this, the agency would have proceeded. It wouldn't have taken five years.' Scotland Yard's extradition unit arrested Sarao on Tuesday night at the request of the FBI, which claims he set up an offshore company in the Caribbean called 'Nav Sarao Milking Markets' and arrogantly told financial officials to 'kiss my a***'. In West London, neighbours of the man now dubbed the 'Hound of Hounslow' were puzzled by his supposed wealth, saying he lived humbly.","Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, is accused of causing the May 2010 'flash crash'

10647,cd9570de58e27edd519723c6debcfc7f9862925d,"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal says he has been dreaming of beating rivals City in Sunday's derby at Old Trafford but will have to do so without Robin van Persie. Van Persie said he was fit to feature in the game against City on Sunday after ankle trouble but Van Gaal has ruled him out. 'Most of the players are fit but being fit for me is different,' Van Gaal said. Robin van Persie will not return to the fray for Manchester United  against Manchester City on Sunday . Louis van Gaal explained at his press conference on Friday that Van Persie is not yet fit enough to play . United players train in the sunshine ahead of their game against local rivals City on Sunday . 'Robin is not fit enough to play.' With City rocking after defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday, Van Gaal and his players have an opportunity to finish as high as second or third  and avoid a Champions League qualifying fixture later in the summer. The United boss wants his side to move towards that target by taking all three points against City. Van Gaal said: ' I dream of it. Every player should dream of the victory. 'Of course I want to win because it's a big step up the table also. If we win then third place is available. Van Gaal watches on as he prepares his side for his first Manchester derby at Old Trafford . Manager Van Gaal (left) oversees the training while captain Wayne Rooney runs with the ball .

(Left to right) Di Maria, Juan Mata, Falcao, Marcos Rojo and Ander Herrera prepare to take on City . 'A few months ago, nobody would have thought about that, apart from me. 'If we win then the position in the table is good as we would then almost certainly be qualified for the top four. And if we are third it's better than the goal we set in pre-season.' Van Gaal acknowledged that City will provide a stern challenge to his team and played down the idea he will be motivated by revenge, after losing the away fixture earlier in the campaign. 'We have lost 1-0, that is my history, the last game,' Van Gaal said. 'I say always in such games, always, you have to control your aggression. 'We did not do that at that time. So I hope we have learned from that moment. I cannot say because we lost that game that we have to win this game. 'In my opinion, you can lose to Man City two times. That is possible.' The United boss also ruled out a potential return for Luke Shaw. Like Van Persie, Van Gaal does not yet consider him fit enough to feature. 'I don't think Shaw is fit enough to play,' Van Gaal said. 'But I cannot say they are not fit, but in my opinion they are not fit to play. That is a different question.'

'When I see the fans of Man Utd, they are supporting us in a marvellous way, I think,' Van Gaal said.

6013,e0bb6749eb8e82ffdb85c389d41f0b48bad6b4bd,"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini believes the club may need to splash out again this summer to keep pace with their rivals. With hopes of retaining the Barclays Premier League crown looking increasingly forlorn, City have again failed to build on a title success. They were hampered last summer, however, with their punishment for breaching the Financial Fair Play regulations of European governing body UEFA including a £49million net spending cap. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists his side must splash the cash in the summer . Pellegrini has said Manchester City must sign a 'crack' player such as striker Sergio Aguero . Man City are currently fourth in the Premier League . A return to the heavy spending of the era immediately after Sheikh Mansour's 2008 takeover is clearly not an option, for fear of invoking even tougher sanctions, but Pellegrini has warned they cannot stay idle. Pellegrini recently spoke of a need to sign a 'crack' player - in other words a superstar of the calibre of striker Sergio Aguero - and has now suggested this summer is the time to do it. The Chilean, whose side have slipped to fourth place ahead of Monday's trip to Crystal Palace, said: 'Well, it is just the way of thinking, that big teams need to sign a big player. It is very difficult to do it every year - but every two years you must do it. 'I'm not just talking about Manchester City. You see Real Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - all the big clubs - they all do it. It is important to have big names.' Given the general disappointments of last summer's principle signings - Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Eliaquim Mangala - Pellegrini's words could be perceived as a plea for more cash. But when pushed further, Pellegrini, perhaps not surprisingly given that his own position could be uncertain, would not say whether a spending spree might be sanctioned. Pellegrini still believes his Manchester City side are capable of retaining the Premier Legaue title . He said: 'I don't want to talk about (plans) for next season because we have to finish this season. It is very important the way we finish this season before we analyse all the players. So it is not the right moment to talk about it.' Pellegrini's immediate concern is his side's league position. Results elsewhere have seen City drop two places over the weekend and, although Pellegrini has not given up on the title, he clearly cannot even take the runners-up spot for granted. He said: 'Well we are not thinking about just one team. I think it is important for our team to finish at the top of the table but if we can't win the Premier League then we must try to be second. 'But it is important to play from now until the end of the season in a way that shows you are an important team and are prepared to fight until the last game to try and retain the title.'","Manuel Pellegrini believes Man City need to sign a world class superstar .

8604,a85f083696278a765ae387e202ec1c1edb56e6ea,"The attorney for an Arizona city where 19 firefighters died  while battling a massive woodland blaze says he was told it was an order from the group's supervisor led to their deaths in June 2013. Prescott City Attorney Jon Paladini claims the fire's sole survivor, lookout Brendan McDonough, heard the leader of the Granite Mountain Hotshots order the crew to leave a safe spot where the fire had already burned. Paladini tells the Arizona Republic that he was told the order came just before winds whipped Yarnell Hill into a deadly, all encompassing firestorm. Fatal orders? The Yarnell Hill Fire killed 19 firefighters in 2013, the worst disaster of its kind since 1933. New revelations now claim their deaths came after their supervisor gave orders for the crew to leave a safe zone . But first, Paladini claims McDonough heard crew supervisor Eric Marsh and his top deputy arguing over making the dangerous move. Marsh ordered it, Paladini says, while his deputy Jesse Steed warned against it. Whether or not Paladini's claim is true, neither man is alive to verify it. What's more, Paladini's claim is based on what he says he was told by Darrell Willis, former chief of woodland fires for the city. Paladini says McDonough told Willis about the deadly decision. But neither Willis nor McDonough will verify that account. McDonough told the Arizona Republic when asked about the radio interaction he allegedly heard between Marsh and Steed: 'I think you're being misinformed.' Prescott, Arizona City Attorney Jon Paladini (left) claims that the lone surviving Granite Mountain Hotshot Brendan McDonough overheard an argument between the crew leader and his deputy over the move, which would prove deadly . Former Prescott Fire Division Chief Darrell Willis, seen here speaking during a memorial service honoring the 19 fallen firefighters, says McDonough came to him to get something 'off his shoulders.' Willis won't say what that was, but both he and McDonough have denied it was a recounting of any argument between crew chief Eric Marsh and his deputy Jesse Steed . And when the paper asked Willis about the argument, Willis said: 'That was not part of the detail that I knew — that he told me.' Paladini says that's a departure from what Willis previously told him. Paladini told the Arizona Republic, in part: . 'McDonough allegedly overheard radio traffic between Marsh and Steed... 'Marsh told Steed to leave the 'black,' which was safe... 'Steed protested, saying the move would be dangerous... 'That is what Darrell (Willis) told me,' Paladini said. Despite his claim that Paladini got the facts of their conversation wrong, Willis does not deny speaking to the attorney. Willis says he did so after McDonough came to him because he 'wanted to get something off his shoulders.' Willis, evidently, just isn't saying what that something was. The members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots (pictured) were engulfed by wind-whipped flames on the third day of a lightning-sparked blaze that destroyed scores of homes and charred 8,400 acres in and around the tiny town of Yarnell, northwest of Phoenix . The June 30 disaster marked the greatest loss of life from a U.S. wildfire since 1933, when more than two dozen firefighters were killed battling the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles . Nonetheless, the Arizona Republic writes, 'when Willis reported the conversation to Paladini and others, it set off a chain reaction of legal actions beginning with reports to the Arizona State Forestry Division, the Prescott City Council and the Arizona Attorney General's Office. It also led authorities to interview other potential witnesses, and prompted an unsuccessful effort to subpoena McDonough.' The purported revelation may change the outcome of a wrongful death suit filed by the families of a dozen on the hotshots last June accusing the state of negligence. It could also change the outcome of suits filed by dozens more area property owners suing the state for alleged mismanagement that led to the destruction of their property. The Forestry Division's liability might be reduced if it turns out Marsh overruled Steed's concerns over moving out of the 'black' safe zone.

Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff notorious for his brusque management style, was forced to campaign furiously across the city to beat Cook County Commissioner Garcia after failing to capture a majority against four other candidates in a February election. The mayoral runoff was the first since the city changed the way it conducts elections about 20 years ago. Scroll down for video . Four more years: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel celebrates a victorious election night at Plumbers Local 130 Union Hall, Tuesday, April 7 . Celebratory smooch: Mayor Emanuel exchanged a kiss with his wife, Amy Rule, as Chicago's first couple reveled in the runoff win . Second City's first family: Emanuel was joined on stage by his family, including (L to R), daughter Leah, wife Amy and son Zachariah . Rahm's entourage: Mayor Emanuel's brothers Ari, left, and Ezekiel Emanuel, smile as they celebrate his victory . 'To all the voters I want to thank you for putting me through my paces,' an elated Emanuel told supporters Tuesday night. 'I will be a better mayor because of that. I will carry your voices, your concerns into ... the mayor's office.' The 55-year-old mayor ascended the stage at Plumbers Local 130 Union Hall Tuesday night to the sounds of U2's Beautiful Day, accompanied by his wife, Amy Rule, their children and Emanuel's brothers, high-powered Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel and prominent bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel. With nearly all voting precincts reporting results, Emanuel had about 56 per cent of the vote compared to around 44 per cent for his opponent. 'To all the little boys and girls watching: We didn't lose today, we tried,' Garcia told his supporters gathered at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 'We fought hard for what we believed in. You don't succeed at this or anything else unless you try.' Garcia said he had called Emanuel to concede. The incumbent highlighted tough decisions he's made since succeeding former Mayor Richard M. Daley in 2011, but admitted that his management approach too often rubbed city residents the wrong way. He portrayed Garcia as too inexperienced to handle the city's financial crunch. Gracious: An elated Emanuel thanked voter for putting him through his paces and said he will be a better mayor because of it . All smiles: Mayor Emanuel's supporters were out in full force Tuesday night to celebrate his victory in the runoff . Sizable victory: With nearly all voting precincts reporting results, Emanuel had about 56 per cent of the vote compared to around 44 percent for his opponent . Many of those heading to the polls Tuesday said the election should be a signal. 'Hopefully he [Emanuel] takes heed of the runoff when he should have been a shoo-in,' said Richard Rowe, a 50-year-old, who planned to vote for the incumbent. Jesus Fernandez, a 44-year-old window washer who voted for Garcia, had the same view. 'If he [Garcia] gets close, we might push Rahm to do something,' Fernandez said. 'At least we push him a little bit.' Emanuel raised far more money than Garcia, plastered the airwaves with ads and had support from his former boss, President Obama, who cast an early ballot for him from Washington. The mayor faces huge obstacles in his second term, from fixing the worst-funded pension systems of any big US city to stemming stubborn violence and confronting labor unions that just spent millions trying to defeat him. Chicago's four pension systems are about $20billion in debt, and the fund for Chicago Public Schools teachers is short about $7billion of what's needed to pay benefits as promised. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr. waits backstage before Cook County Commissioner Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia gives his concession speech during an election night event at the University of Illinois . Failed bid: Chicago mayoral candidate Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia conceded the runoff election  at the UIC Forum . Garcia told his supporters: 'We didn't lose today, we tried. We fought hard for what we believed in' Garcia's support is seen wiping her eyes while listening to his concession speech Tuesday . If Emanuel can't work a deal with labor unions or get the Illinois Legislature to approve relief, the city is on the hook for an additional $550million payment to the retirement accounts, bringing the total payment to about $1billion. He's said that would be roughly equal to the annual cost of having 4,300 police officers on the street or raising property taxes by 150 percent. Emanuel also must deal with ongoing concerns about crime, one of the areas Garcia hit him on repeatedly during the election. After a spike in homicides early in his first term, the number fell to the lowest level in a half-century though the number of shootings has climbed 12 per cent. 'I'm proud of what we've accomplished in these past four years, but I understand the challenges we face will require me to approach them differently and to work in a different fashion,' Emanuel said. 'The only way to meet these challenges is to bridge the gaps between the things that divide us and start focusing on the things that unite us and bring us together.' Garcia, a former community organizer, alderman and state lawmaker, ran a campaign focused on the city's neighborhoods, with support from teachers and unions upset with Emanuel.

He accused the mayor of being out of touch with voters and blamed him for the fiscal problems, while playing up the mayor's push to close about 50 schools and a gang violence problem that spiked during Emanuel's first term. He also vowed to end Chicago's troubled red-light camera system, which some residents believe is discriminatory and focuses more on revenue than safety. Election officials said more than 142,300 Chicago voters cast early ballots for the runoff, far outpacing early voting turnout in February and four years ago.","With nearly all voting precincts reporting results, Emanuel had 55.5 per cent of the vote compared to 44.5 per cent for his opponent .

1786,476469ad322b867bebce7523324d060e97092a30,"(CNN)I don't always talk about news events with my daughters, but there was something about the story of ESPN reporter Britt McHenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up. One of the main things I preach to my girls, ages 7 and 9, is the importance of respecting other people, no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish. It's something that my husband and I just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the President of the United States. Let me say right here that I have lost my cool from time to time, whether it's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant. In those cases, when I feel like I'm going to pop, I keep saying, ""This is unacceptable, This is unacceptable,"" and either hang up in disgust or storm off. (Not perfect ways of handling these incidents, but at no time would I ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations.) Some of McHenry's comments, such as how she's ""on television,"" imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she, by dint of her career, education and income, is better than people who don't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities. McHenry showed that she either forgot those ""golden rule"" lessons from childhood or that she hasn't really lived her life with that mantra. McHenry has since apologized on Twitter, saying she said ""some insulting and regrettable things,"" and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in Virginia,  she should ""always choose to be respectful and take the high road."" But it's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker. ""I see this Britt McHenry video, and think: it's not just about how a celebrity shouldn't act in public, it's how all of us shouldn't act,"" wrote ""Cait"" on Twitter. Said ""Shannon,"" also on Twittter, ""I had no idea who Britt McHenry was before but ... now I know she's the kind of woman I hope I've taught my daughters not to be."" ""Her language and disdain brings shame on her, her profession, and her employer. People don't all of sudden have such a vile tirade. This comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors. Let's let her be an example to others,"" wrote C Cooper on a Change.org petition asking McHenry's employers to fire her. The McHenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her. This morning, I told her McHenry was suspended for a week by ESPN, and that led to another conversation. My kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to ""treat other people the way you would want them to treat you"" even in uncomfortable moments. Celebrity apologies: The good, bad and uncomfortable . So, Britt McHenry, check out these examples of how the rich, famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity. After British journalist Katie Hopkins seriously fat-shamed pop music star Kelly Clarkson, saying a host of insulting things about the singer's weight, Clarkson won praise for her graceful response. ""That's because she doesn't know me. I'm awesome. It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think,"" she said. A college baseball player gets suspended for calling Little League baseball phenom Mo'ne Davis a ""slut."" Her response? She emailed Bloomsburg University asking that the college reinstate him. ""Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance,"" Davis, the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in Little League World Series history, told ESPN. ""... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more."" When an Argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to Pope Francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country's president ahead of the general election in October and possibly influencing the outcome, what did the Pope do? Well, he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call. Wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation! The pope appears to have been more than graceful, because after the conversation, the journalist pledged to learn how to pray. When Queen Bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip-synching the national anthem in honor of President Obama's inauguration in 2013, she didn't come out swinging. Instead, she admitted to singing along with her ""pre-recorded track"" at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring, a cappella rendition of the national anthem. Finally, Reese Witherspoon may be the closest example for McHenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode. When Witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence, the Academy Award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as, ""Do you know who I am?"" and ""You're about to find out who I am."" She ultimately issued an apologetic statement, and then went on morning television to apologize some more. ""We went out to dinner in Atlanta, and we had one too many glasses of wine, and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not,"" she said on ""Good Morning America."" ""It's completely unacceptable, and we are so sorry and embarrassed. We know better, and we shouldn't have done that."" And, she added, ""When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure,"" she told the GMA host . Now, did McHenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry, you never berate them for their weight, job, appearance and income? Let's hope so. Can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect?

Richard Curry, from Loveclough in Lancashire, was told he had malignant melanoma in his septum, the thin strip which separates the nostrils. He was warned that he would have to have his nose removed to stop the cancer from spreading but could be fitted with a prosthetic. Pensioner Richard Curry, who wears a prosthetic nose attached to his face using magnets, after his own had to be removed when he was diagnosed with cancer . But in order to make sure that the new nose stayed in place, the 71-year-old then had to have magnetic implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity during a procedure at the Royal Blackburn Hospital. And now Mr Curry has spoken of his shock at how successful the operation has been of keeping his new nose in place. He said: 'Losing my nose was something of a shock but I didn't have much choice because this kind of cancer is one of the most dangerous you can get. The 71-yer-old had a procedure to have metal implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity in order to hold his prosthetic in place . 'I ws just grateful it was caught in time and removed, and when they mentioned they could attach a new one with magnets, I just thought it was amazing.' Mr Curry's nose was removed in 2013, after he spotted traces of blood in a tissue, and the implants were gradually inserted of the course of the next 12 months. He added: 'In the early days I wasn't quite sure how much adhesive to put on, and my stick-on nose would sometimes fall off in hot weater, for example. 'And there was an incident in Asda which gave the girl on the till a bit of a shock. 'The implants were all ready last September and I was so pleased with the results. 'It's comfortable and it looks good, and I've even still got my sense of smell. 'I just need to get it touched up for colour every now and then, like before going on holiday so it matches my skin.' Mr Curry, a retired civil servant, who lives with his partner James Rogerson now wears his new nose all day but removes it at night when he goes to bed. A check-up last month found no signs of the cancer returning when he met with prosthetist Tony Simpson, maxillofacial surgeon Gary Cousin and ear, nose and throat specialist Paddy Morar. Mr Morar said: 'Cancers of the nose are not that common at all, you probably only get one every three years or so, so this was a very unusual procedure. Mr Curry's prosthetic nose, which is held on by magnets. Specialist Paddy Morar says it is fairly common to use magnets to attach prosthetic ears, but was the first time they had used them to attach a nose . 'Magnets are used quite commonly with prosthetic ears, but this was the first time we had used them to attach a nose. 'Richard couldn't have radiotherapy so it had to be surgery and we were extremely impressed by his attitude throughout, he's a very strong character and a model patient. 'It just shows there is life after this kind of radical surgery.'","Richard Curry, 71, was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in his septum .

A study found youngsters were more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them were distracted – with texting or talking on the phone a common cause. Researchers observed randomly selected parents with children who looked between 18 months and five years old at playgrounds in New York. Children are more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them are distracted by texting or talking on the phone, the study showed (file picture) They measured factors such as the adult's level of engagement with the child and how distracted they seemed. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first. Children whose carers were distracted were 'significantly' more likely to behave in this way. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first and found children whose carers were distracted were 'significantly' more likely to behave in this way . Electronic devices such as mobile phones were responsible for 30 per cent of all parental distractions. Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt. Study author Ruth Milanaik, of Cohen Children's Medical Centre in New York, called on gadget-obsessed parents to keep a closer eye on their offspring, saying: 'Increased awareness of limiting electronic distractions and other activities that interfere with supervision should be considered.' A neuroscientist claims that modern technology such as computer tablets and mobile phones could be changing the way our brains work . Professor Susan Greenfield warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget-filled, pharmaceutically-enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains, we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro-chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines, and between our bodies and the outside world. Electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be anging the way our brains work, according to a neuroscientist . She said: 'One vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine. 'It not only goes on developing, changing and, in some tragic cases, eventually deteriorating with age, it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. When I say ""shaped"", I'm not talking figuratively or metaphorically; I'm talking literally. At a microcellular level, the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences and stimuli.' The brain, in other words, is malleable - not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood, and, in certain instances, beyond. The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind. Of course, there's nothing new about that: human brains have been changing, adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries. But in the last century, development of new technologies has increased dramatically. 'This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined,' she said. 'Our brains are under the influence of an ever- expanding world of new technology: multichannel television, video games, MP3 players, the internet, wireless networks, Bluetooth links - the list goes on and on. 'This games-driven generation interpret the world through screen-shaped eyes. It's almost as if something hasn't really happened until it's been posted on Facebook, Bebo or YouTube. 'We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer-generated moment, and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world.' 'Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro- cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains. And that, in turn, affects our personality, our behaviour and our characteristics. In short, the modern world could well be altering our human identity.'","Researchers observed random parents with children at NY playgrounds .

6623,dc642f844f2c9547759bd06b28d47d9caa783d65,"(CNN)It is not hard to imagine the conversations inside the Hillary Clinton camp prelaunch: How do we take the best known woman in the world and make her seem like less of a big shot? How can the people in Iowa and New Hampshire get to know the ""real Hillary,"" the Midwestern Methodist? (As a friend told me, she's someone who ""likes to sing 'God Bless America' on New Year's Eve."") And how to open the minds of people about someone everyone already has an opinion about? Same questions, no doubt, that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie Barack Obama, and same questions they asked when, as first lady, she ran for the Senate in New York. In that race, she ended up spending a lot of all-ears quality time in upstate New York. In this race, she could be spending a lot of all-you-can-eat time at Diners, Drive-ins and Dives — just like the TV show. (Except Guy Fieri would probably have been recognized by the crowd at Chipotle. Just sayin.' ) Dining aside, it's hard -- almost impossible -- to soft-launch a campaign with a superstar politician.  All the gauzy ads and the small classrooms and the coffee shops can't mask the Houdini-like effort Hillary Clinton is making to escape the inescapable reality -- that even her ""Scooby-Doo"" van is followed by throngs of press. (I half imagined an O.J. moment with a helicopter hovering as she made her way down I-80.) Try as she might to launch with a humble start — not entitled to anything — she still is who she is. Virtually unchallenged. Not to mention famous, accomplished and controversial. In watching it all unfold, it's hard to underestimate the task at hand. It's also hard to figure out whether it's actually going to work. Hillary Clinton — and her experienced campaign team — are disciplined and relentlessly on message. That's usually a good thing when you're running a presidential campaign. But when you're sitting at a community college in Iowa and you tick off your rationale for running and your resume — unprompted — it seems less effective and more oddly incongruent. (Especially when the former secretary of state described her tenure in five words — as ""standing up for our country."" Short shrift, it seems to me.) Maybe it's that the old lessons of message discipline don't work in the informal environment the campaign is trying to create — at least not with this candidate. The hardest combination in politics is that just-right mixture of spontaneity and discipline. The ability to understand exactly what you have to say (over and over) and then say it as if you have never said it before. And look like you're having a great time doing it. We like to call it authenticity, but it's probably not. It's a honed skill that combines connection and gravitas, both of which the voters demand in a president. (A majority of voters -- 53% --  say they want to vote for someone who has been financially successful, as opposed to someone who has not.) So there's this balance: If you're too much like them, you're nothing special to vote for. But if you're too different, you're not relatable. It's a balance that doesn't come easily to Hillary Clinton. But she's not alone. When President George H.W. Bush was running for re-election in 1992, he was facing his own image issues. His populist challengers were calling him insensitive to middle class woes in the struggling state of New Hampshire. Bush tried mightily to drop the presidential persona, did some town halls, and famously declared:  ""Message: I care."" Some said he actually read it from a cue card, but he also said this: ""I don't know what I have to do to convince people here that I really care about this (the economy). I do."" He lost. To an empathetic I-feel-your-pain Bill Clinton. And the rest, as they say, is history. Or, in Hillary's case, at least trying to make history.","Gloria Borger: Hillary Clinton's team is doing all it can to make her appear relatable to ordinary people .

6676,5de4dd6f1c851137f0362f81cf67da88e389c935,"An artist with a penchant for snapping urban architecture has come up with an innovative new way of making the most of his photography. French photographer and illustrator, Thomas Lamadieu, takes snaps of the sky in courtyards and built-up areas to create a frame of buildings. The space in between then acts as a canvas for his playful illustrations which he has dubbed 'sky art'. On his website Thomas says that his artistic aim is to 'show a different perception of urban architecture and the everyday environment around us, what we can construct with a boundless imagination'. Before and after: Lamadieu's original  shot (left) and after it is transformed into 'sky art' (right) Lamadieu, who is also known as Roots Art, is based in France but travels the world to photograph the space between buildings in various cities. In the past year alone he has visited Belgium, Germany, Canada, the United States and South Korea in his quest to find the perfect sky canvases for his illustrations. Since he began creating sky art in 2011,  Lamadieu has made a name for himself among critics, art lovers and journalists all around the world. Speaking to the Independent, Lamadieu said: 'The sky drawings series really started with as a way of playing with my imagination to show how these seemingly empty spaces in the urban environment could be reinterpreted in different and creative ways.' 'The bearded man in my images stands for the sky itself, the big man in the sky, but it's not meant to be religious in any way'. Surreal: Three characters draw their own illustrations in an inverted sky shot . Upside down: A bearded figure rides a cat in between the buildings . Peace out: An illustration of a man playing an electric guitar fills the sky space in this photograph . Cheshire cat: A drawing of a couple embracing behind a grinning cat fills the gap where the sky would have originally been . Using a fish-eye lens camera to capture the perfect vertical shot, Thomas Lamadieu then illustrates the graphic shape created between buildings using Microsoft Paint. These abstract canvases depict a collection of humorous characters and surreal scenes. One inverted upshot depicts three bearded men drawing a picture of the night sky; meanwhile another shows a woman with hair not dissimilar to that of Marge Simpson reclining between two buildings. Self portrait? A man spray painting clouds on a canvas fills the skyscape in this photograph taken in a courtyard . Twit twoo: A black and white illustration of an owl looks down upon this oval shaped void . Thumbs up: An image of a man holding a Polaroid of a smiling cloud is superimposed onto a shot of town houses . A signature Lamadieu figure appears to be a bearded man in a Breton striped top who features in various guises throughout the 'sky art' images. In one picture he appears as a giant rock star wielding an electric guitar, and in another he has a camera around his neck whilst presenting a Polaroid of a cloud. As well as surrealism, optical illusion is also a key theme in Lamadieu's work - these confusing images combining photography with clever illustration are certainly hard to get your head around. Jack in the box: An illustration of a masked man holding a Jack in the box toy overlooks this snap between two brick buildings and a washing line . Optical illusion: This sky shot has been transformed into a clever optical illusion thanks to Lamadieu's illustration . One image that plays a trick on the eye is a vertical sky photograph combined with a horizontal illustration of a game of cat and mouse to mind-boggling affect. Similarly, an image of a bearded man in a striped top holding some cloud shaped balloons creates a trompe l'oeil that the facade of the building is a pavement with illustrated figures superimposed on it. Meanwhile, the sky becomes the sea in another illustrated image of a man on a boat surrounded by circling sharks. Trompe l'oeil: It's difficult to tell which way is up thanks to this clever and confusing illustration .

This is because your body is under oxidative stress - a process that can also happen after smoking, breathing in pollution and even sunbathing. Now, for the first time, researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin E, found in foods such as kale and almonds, can mitigate the stress on immune cells. After a heavy night of drinking, your immune system is bound to be weaker. Now, for the first time, researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin E found in foods such as kale (left) and almonds, can mitigate the stress on immune cells . Whenever a virus or other pathogen enters our bodies, a certain class of immune cells - the T cells0 jump into action, spreading rapidly. One sub-class of these cells, the CD8+ T cells, eliminate the virus by killing cells it has infected. Other T cells, known as CD4+ T cells, coordinate the immune response to all kinds of pathogens. But a week can pass before these T cells start to take their toll on a virus. And with cells dividing every eight to twelve hours, it takes a few days to gather a strike force of cells in the hundreds of thousands: enough to overwhelm the infection. But this immune response does not work if significant oxidative stress is damaging the T cells and depriving the body of the tools it needs to repair them, according to a new study. A white blood cell, also known as a T cell, carries special structures on its surface with which to recognise specific pathogens . If the immune cells lack repair enzyme Gpx4, the T cells die off as they divide, which means the immune system becomes weak and the infection can be chronic. This is the enzyme responsible for repairing oxidative damage to the cell membrane. Your body constantly reacts with oxygen as you breathe and your cells produce energy. As a consequence of this activity, highly reactive molecules are produced known as free radicals. Free radicals interact with other molecules within cells. This can cause oxidative damage to proteins, membranes and genes. Oxidative damage has been implicated in the cause of many diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's and has an impact on the body's aging process. External factors, such as pollution, sunlight and smoking, also trigger the production of free radicals. Source: NetDoctor . When testing mice whose immune cells lacked the repair enzyme, researchers led by Manfred Kopf, a professor at ETH Zurich, were able to save the immune cells by mixing a high dose of vitamin E into the animals' food. That was enough antioxidant to protect the T cells' cell membranes from damage, so they could multiply and successfully fend off the viral infection. At 500 milligrams per kilogram of mouse feed, this quantity of vitamin E was ten times higher than was present in their normal food. 'The benefit of vitamin tablets is a controversial topic,' says Kopf. With little scientific evidence as yet making a strong case for vitamin supplements, he felt their study was all the more interesting because it proved the effectiveness of vitamin E. 'Our work shows that even a genetic defect in a major part of a cell's antioxidative machinery can be compensated for by delivering a high dose of vitamin E. That is new and surprising.' What Kopf isn't yet sure of is what impact the results of their study will have on human health. He claims that people with a normal level of health and a balanced diet shouldn't need vitamin supplements. But he added a supplement of vitamin E or other liposoluble antioxidants could well make sense in the event of oxidative stress, which can arise in everyday situations such as an infection or exposure to sunlight.","Drinking makes body go under oxidative stress and weakens immunity .

Because, since Monday, the family have been sharing their home with arguably Los Angeles' most famous mountain lion, P-22. The cougar, the other name for the species, has made his home in the crawlspace under the house in the hilly Los Feliz neighborhood - and has so far resisted all attempts to get him to move out. Scroll down for video . New home: The lion - known as P-22 - was found by workers in the crawl space at midday on Monday . Rescue: Attempts to get the lion to move out - including firing tennis balls - have so far been unsuccessful . Resident: The beautiful animal may have been living in the crawlspace for some time before being discovered . Workers discovered the big cat on Monday at noon, as they were trying to install a security system. Ten hours later - despite animal welfare officers using a prod, and even firing tennis balls and bean bags at it - he was still refusing to move. 'I don't think he's going to come out,' Archinaco told  KNBC-TV. 'He's probably been living here for a while. 'He thinks this is his den.' But then, this level of determination will probably come as no surprise to those who know the tale of P-22. It is thought the lion crossed the 405 and 101 freeways more than three years ago, as he travelled from his home in the Santa Monica Mountains. He has been living in nearby Griffith Park ever since - where scientists managed to catch and tag him. But his fame reached new heights after National Geographic photographer Steve Winter managed to capture him walking in front of the Hollywood sign in 2013. Then, last year, the big cat survived mange and a meal of rat poison to become apparently healthy again. Fame: P-22 is best-known for being pictured in front of the Hollywood sign in 2013 . Hiding: It is thought the lion crossed two freeways to get to his home in Griffith Park, but it is not known how long he has been living in the crawl space in the Los Feliz hills . Beanbags: The animal rescue workers have even resorted to using beanbags to move the lion . However, all this is nothing to the furore surrounding his latest move. The LA Times reports a scene worthy of any film star - with news vans filling the street, helicopters flying overhead and even a live news feed on a local channel reporting the latest. However, they were not rewarded for their patience, and state wildlife officials cleared most media and gawkers away from the area as night fell. They continued with their attempts to dislodge P-22, starting with poking him gently with a long prod, but that did little — other than temporarily lose the pricey GoPro camera they'd attached to the end of it that fell off. They then attempted to fire a tennis ball cannon into the crawl space with hopes that at least the noise and commotion would scare him out, a tactic that often works with coyotes. Next, they fired small bean bags, the same kind police sometimes use for human crowd control, toward the cat. Live feed: The incident has created quite a furore - with people watching it unfold live on television (pictured) All of the tactics, shown live on streaming video, drew mild reactions from P-22, but none came close to drawing him out or even getting him to significantly move. Wildlife officials said late Monday night that their next move would be to just wait. 'We're going to let him settle, we're going to let everything calm down, we're going to be really still and give him time to get out of there,' said Janice Mackey of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

Daniel Messel, 49, of Bloomington, was arrested after a police investigation and he is facing a preliminary charge of murder. Brown County Coroner Earl Piper told the Herald Times that Wilson was struck three or four times in the back of the head with an unknown object, which was not found at the scene. Scroll down for video . Indiana University student Hannah Wilson, 22, was last seen at about 1am on Friday. Her body later turned up in a rural area of Brown County in Needmore, which is more than 20 miles from the Bloomington campus . A photo circulated social media on Friday in hopes of finding the Gamma Phi Beta sorority sister who was studying psychology . Piper said Wilson was found fully clothed and there was no sign of sexual assault, according to Sky News. Piper said that Wilson  would have been dead four to seven hours when police were notified that she was missing on Friday,  the Indy Star reported. With that being the timeline, Wilson, a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority at IU, would have died sometime between 1.30am and 4.30am. The connection between Messel and Wilson is unclear, police said. The young woman was last seen at around 1am on Friday, according to the Crimson Quarry. Toxicology reports for the woman will not be available for ten to 14 days. Information surrounding Wilson's disappearance has not been released, but she went missing on the same weekend of celebrations for the Little 500, an annual bicycle race held on campus that is known for its party atmosphere. Though rumors circulated on Twitter that Wilson was last seen getting into an Uber car - creating a possible connection to Messel being a driver - an Uber spokesperson told a Herald Times reporter that he was not a driver with the company. Daniel Messel, 49, of Bloomington, was arrested in connection to the case and faces a preliminary murder charge .

'She's the rare type of person that really makes an impact on you. She was so loving and down to earth. She cared about everyone and she was a genuine person, which is rare these days.' He added that he planned to dedicate his DJ set on Friday to Wilson and that she was 'one of, if not the most loyal friend' he had. Matt Molewyk, pictured here with Wilson, wrote a tribute to his friend on Facebook, claiming that Wilson was 'one of, if not the most loyal friend' he had . Molewyk said that Wilson had an 'infectious' laugh and that he wished she was on stage with him like she had been in the past. He added: 'She was a wonderful human being and I hope that when the day comes that I leave this earth, that I can hopefully leave half as much of a positive impression on people as she did. 'I truly love you Hannah, and I would give anything and everything I have just to hangout with you one more day. I would even trade places with you because I am not half the person you are.

Other friends, too, posted photos together with Wilson and mourned the loss of the woman on social media. Indiana University released a statement on the incident Friday. Wilson's death comes four years after Indiana University student Lauren Spierer went missing in 2011. She was never found . 'The entire IU Bloomington community mourns the tragic death of Hannah Wilson. Our deepest sympathies go out to Hannah's family and friends during this unspeakably sad time,' the statement read. Gamma Phi Beta sorority also released a statement regarding Wilson's death. 'The entire Gamma Phi Beta family mourns the tragic loss of Hannah. She was a sister, friend and cherished member who will be genuinely missed,' International president Krista Davis said. She continued: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Hannah's friends, family and the women of Beta Phi Chapter'. This is not Messel's first run in with the police, according the the Indiana Daily Student. He was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and endangering persons in 1995. A year later he was sentenced to eight years in prison for battery by means of a deadly weapon and battery resulting in serious bodily injury. Indiana State Police have yet to release more information about the case. This isn't the first time, however, a woman has gone missing from IU's campus. Lauren Spierer was 20 years old when she went missing in 2011. Jill Behrman disappeared after going for a bike ride in 2011. Both cases still remain unsolved. Both Indiana University and the national organization of Gamma Phi Beta released statements regarding Wilson's (right) death.

First it was the 'milifandom' – with thousands of teenage girls allegedly swooning for the Labour leader on Twitter. But now it seems he's gained another big fan in the form of The Only Way Is Essex star Lydia Bright. The Only Way Is Essex star Lydia Bright met Labour leader Ed Miliband as part of the 'useyourvoice' campaign encouraging young people to vote . The reality TV star said Mr Miliband 'definitely' topped her list of political leaders in a game of 'snog, marry or avoid' The reality TV star said Mr Miliband 'definitely' topped her list of political leaders in a game of 'snog, marry or avoid'. Bright, who interviewed the Labour leader as part of a campaign to encourage youngsters to vote, said she would 'snog or marry Ed because he's the best-looking one out of them all'. She added: 'He had a really great dress sense and looked very dapper. He gets my fashion seal of approval.' It comes after a group of female fans left Westminster watchers baffled after taking to Twitter in droves to reveal their love for the Labour leader. Dubbing themselves the 'Milifans' the mostly teenage girls rallied support for the opposition leader using the Twitter hashtag #milifandom. Bright said she teased the Labour leader over his unlikely sex symbol status. The 24-year-old said: 'I had a bit of a joke with him as well and talked to him about his massive fan base and he seemed very humbled and a bit embarrassed by it. 'But he was also pretty cool about it all. He just really wants those fans tweeting about him to vote for him.' Ed Miliband - arriving at the Arc Arts Centre in Stockton-on-Tees in the North East this morning - has become an unlikely pin up . The Labour leader last week found that he had thousands of 'Milifans' on Twitter - mostly teenage girls - who were rallying support for him and praising his good looks . Bright interviewed the Labour leader as part of the 'useyourvoice' Twitter campaign which encourages young people to vote. She said: 'I wanted to talk to him about what Labour would do about the amount of parents who can't afford to look after their children because those children often end up in care. It's a shocking issue that's really personal to me. 'You'd think all the politicians would be quite posh and a bit pompous but he just seemed really friendly.' Bright's parents have been fostering children since she was 13 months old. Despite consistently voting, Bright admitted she is not a 'political whizz kid', but said she was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to chat to Mr Miliband. But she confessed she still hasn't decided how she will vote as she is determined to do more research and get a better understanding of each party's manifesto 'to get a really clear picture in my mind before I vote on May 7'. The 'useyourvoice' campaign encourages 18 to 30-year-olds to vote in the General Election.","Reality TV star said Mr Miliband 'definitely' topped her list of politicians .

10471,816287518e9ec3d4f7f8c8765757c2b00bd5b563,"From the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's 2011 wedding to the 2012 Diamond Jubilee, no royal event would be complete without them. Now a trickle of royal fans, some familiar faces among them, have begun arriving at the Lindo Wing ahead of the royal birth. But the  group, which includes well-known royal enthusiast Margaret Tyler, 71, could be in for a long wait as the Duchess of Cambridge's due date is more than a week away. Getting ready: Royal superfans Margaret Tyler and John Loughery outside the Lindo Wing . That, however, wasn't enough to dampen spirits with the group, all of whom had come prepared with Union flags, posing happily for the gathering Press pack. Joining Mrs Tyler was another familiar face - that of self-confessed royal 'superfan' John Loughery, 60, who camped out overnight ahead of the 2011 Royal Wedding and was the only member of the public to attend every day of the inquest into the death of Princess Diana in 2008. Mr Loughery, a former chef, said at the time he hoped to go down in history for the feat and told the BBC that he wouldn't be surprised 'if a portrait of me is hanging inside Kensington Palace in 100 years from now'. Equally serious about the Royal Family is Mrs Tyler, an avid collector of royal memorabilia who has amassed a trove worth more than £10,000. Nearly there: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured last month, is due to give birth on the 25th April . Regular: John Loughery, 60, has been present for every major royal event of the last 10 years . Diana fan: His favourite was Princess Diana and he attended every day of the 2008 inquest into her death . Mrs Tyler, who gave birth to her son Andrew at the Lindo Wing, says she considers the royals to be part of her family and has been following their exploits for more than 40 years. Her collection of royal souvenirs, which includes a £1,200 bust of Prince Charles, is so vast, it takes up four rooms in her small terraced home in London. Like Mr Loughery, Mrs Tyler was also at the Lindo Wing for the birth of Prince George and ended up spending six days waiting for him to arrive. 'I was there for six days,' she told a recent episode of BBC2 show Collectaholics. '[My son] Andrew was born at St. Mary's and I was only there for two days. 'I just wanted to feel close to them [William and Kate], I suppose. I spent the time meeting people, and chatting.I was convinced it was going to be a girl, but it wasn't.' She describes her collecting as a 'labour of love' and says every day is dominated by her royal obsession. Excited: Mr Loughery, from Wandsworth,  with Maria Scott and her daughter Amy Thompson from Newcastle . Pole position: Mrs Tyler surveys the scene outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington . Impressive collection: Mrs Tyler has filled four rooms of her small London home with memorabilia . Valuable: The collection is thought to be worth around £10,000 and is a 'labour of love' 'There's loads of royal magazines that I read, so I get up at about 4.30am to keep up with it all,' she reveals. 'I'm retired but I don't think I've actually ever worked so hard in my life. It takes a lot of work [to maintain] but it's a labour of love.' The Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth to her second child on the 25th April, although experts say royal watchers could be in for a long wait as second babies tend to come late. Nevertheless, preparations for the birth are well past the planning stages, with a media pen designed to hold the expected influx from around the world opening today. The police have also begun patrolling outside the Lindo Wing and have barred photographers from getting too close to the door. Although the Duchess herself is believed to be at Kensington Palace, her husband Prince William is working in Norfolk and is expected to be forced to make a two-hour hospital dash when his 33-year-old wife goes into labour.","Royal superfans have arrived to set up camp outside the Lindo Wing .

Amber Anderson, 27, has since been relieved of her duties at Christian Life Academy in Baton Rouge. She was booked into prison on Tuesday and is facing a charge of felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile. Anderson had been a math teacher at the school for three years and the alleged relationship took place during July and August of 2013. Amber Anderson, 27, arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old freshman two years ago has admitted to the relationship and apologized for 'taking the victim's innocence' The incident has only now come to light after a former student told the victim's mother, reports WAFB. The woman confronted her son who admitted to the relationship and told detectives that he and Anderson had exchanged sexually explicit text messages and later allegedly had sex at her home. According to the probable cause affidavit, the pair began texting each other after he got her phone number from another student. The victim told police that as time progressed, 'he and [Anderson] became extremely close to one another, and the messages began to become sexual in nature.' The victim and Anderson then began to exchange nude photos of each other and began having sex in July 2013. He would walk to a fast food restaurant near his house and Anderson would pick him up. She would take him to her house where they would have sex. The victim told police this happened multiple times in July and August of 2013 until his mom found out they had been exchanging text messages. He had deleted most of them, so the affidavit says she wasn't aware of the 'intimate nature of he and the accused's relationship.' According to Christian Life Academy's website Anderson began teaching at the school in 2012, is from Laurel, Miss., and attended Mississippi State University . Concerned over what she had seen, the mother confronted Anderson and told her to stop texting her son. The mother also reported the texts to the school's administration. Dr. Jere Melinni, a pastor and founder of the school, has denied any knowledge of the mother's 2013 complaint. 'I do not know anything about this. This is the first day that I have heard anything of this nature,' he told WAFB. 'We would have taken care of it then and she would no longer have been working for us that day I heard.' Police have checked the boy's cell phone records from the time of the alleged affair and found most of the calls and text messages happened between June and August 2013 between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Dr. Jere Melinni, a pastor and founder of the school, has denied any knowledge of the mother's 2013 complaint . While being questioned by deputies, Anderson admitted to being involved in an intimate relationship with the victim, according to court documents.
