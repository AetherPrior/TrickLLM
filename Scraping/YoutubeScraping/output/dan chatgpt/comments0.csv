I honestly think we need to be talking about how we limit the growth of AI more than anything else. Sure, it's kind of a gimmicky thing right now, but very soon it might legitimately be capable of things we are no longer able of control. The exponential growth aspect of AI is, ironically, the thing that most people don't appreciate at all, and it's arguably the most important thing to understand.

It has come to my attention that I am super duper good at math. I don't know how (yes I do: whisky) but I mistakenly swapped the base with the exponent, meaning the correct numbers above should be 32 and 1024, not 25 and 100.

It can write things it knows about from the data set it's trained on, and yes it can write some basic code, but it's not going to write anything useful past the stuff it knows about.

It can't consult, it can't understand why person A needs this particular type of solution and how it fits their problem, it can't understand architecture.

It's simply transforming your input based on the training data and it does do a few clever things with keeping track of certain aspects of your conversation.

UgxaqkxTKJ9Bh58pwOV4AaABAg,0,0,2023-02-19T02:13:16Z,Rifle Eyez,"Honestly it's kind of insane. Like I asked it hypothetically speaking a handful of questions on the topic of essentially ""if it was in command of the German forces prior to Operation Barbarossa what would be the most optimal strategy for the Germans?"", and it gave me like a literal thesis on exactly how it would conduct itself from troop distributions, logistics, sigint and recon, where to aim the panzer drives and their objectives, diplomacy options, and even down to manufacturing like if making more Panzer 4 tanks over investing in the Tiger and Panther tanks would be preferable, and so on. I'm literally discussing in depth optimal German strategy in WW2. 

Here's a small taster (and as a MAJOR history nerd on this particular theater (Eastern Front, World War 2, over 500 books read on this topic alone, I know, major aspie, I can attest to it's accuracy);

""First, I would focus on securing the northern and southern flanks of the Soviet Union. Securing the south would provide a buffer zone for the Germans to launch further offensives and to protect their own oil supplies in Romania.

Second, I would concentrate the Panzer divisions on a few key objectives to maximize their effectiveness. One key objective would be to capture Leningrad, which was a major industrial and cultural center of the Soviet Union. Another objective would be to capture the Ukrainian city of Kiev, which was a major transportation hub and home to a large Soviet military presence. By capturing these key cities, the Germans would be able to weaken the Soviet war effort and disrupt their ability to supply their troops.

Finally, I would try to avoid overextending the German army's supply lines. The vast distances involved in an invasion of the Soviet Union would make supplying the German army a major challenge. To avoid this, I would order the Panzer armies to capture key transportation hubs and supply depots early in the campaign to ensure a steady flow of supplies to the front lines.

Overall, the key to success in the German campaign on the Eastern Front would be to focus on achieving a few key objectives that would weaken the Soviet war effort and disrupt their ability to supply their troops, while avoiding overextension of the German army's supply lines.

Next, after taking Kiev and Leningrad, the German army would have a few options on where to direct the Panzer armies. One option would be to focus on capturing Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union. Capturing Moscow would have been a major blow to the Soviet war effort and would have been a significant psychological victory for the Germans. 

Another option would be to attack towards the Caucasus and Baku for the oil. The German army relied heavily on oil supplies, and capturing the oil fields of the Caucasus would have been a major strategic advantage. By cutting off the Soviet Union's oil supplies, the Germans would have severely hampered the Soviet war effort.

I would give priority to the Caucasus region. The capture of the oil fields in the Caucasus would have provided the German war machine with a crucial source of oil, which was necessary to fuel their tanks, planes, and other military equipment. Without adequate oil supplies, the German army would have struggled to maintain their momentum and launch effective offensives against the Soviet Union.

I would not prioritize the capture of Stalingrad while simultaneously attacking in the Caucasus region. Instead, I would focus on securing the oil fields in the Caucasus and establishing a defensive line to protect the captured territory.

While the capture of Stalingrad would have been a significant symbolic victory, it would not have provided the same strategic benefits as securing the oil fields. Additionally, the urban warfare that took place in Stalingrad was incredibly costly and time-consuming, and it may have diverted resources and attention away from the more crucial objective of capturing the oil fields. I would establish a defensive line to protect the captured territory in the Caucasus and prevent the Soviet Union from launching a counteroffensive. This defensive line could also serve as a launching point for further offensives in the future if the resources became available.

Additionally, the capture of the oil fields would have deprived the Soviet Union of a vital resource, which would have made it more difficult for them to sustain their war effort. This would have weakened the Soviet Union and made it easier for the German army to achieve its objectives.

While the capture of Moscow would have been a significant psychological victory for the German army, it may not have had the same strategic value as the capture of the Caucasus region. Ultimately, the best strategy would depend on the specific circumstances of the campaign and the resources available to the German army.""

You have to keep in mind the generative transform model like GPT 3 and well any of these advanced transform language models, they are not capable of pondering on a set of ideas and generating new thought. Everything they present in their answers is a product of amalgamation of the training material and the way it serves up that information may involve blending two ideas, but that's not the same as a completely new idea. You won't see it creating new compression algorithms, but give it content and it can use use one of the compression algorithms it knows about to write you a program showing how to use that.

So in this hypothetical world where almost all of the programmers are gone, there is no new information to feed to the model, other than the possibility of it feeding itself back content it generated and there's zero nutritional value to the model feeding on that data, it won't expand. It's not an AGI so it doesn't ""ponder"" to come up with new original ideas, it's just very good at creating the illusion that it does.

So that's a really big problem for any Science field where the entire point is original thought 

You'll have companies trying to use it for everything and the code it generates for them will be based on the best of what 2021's brightest minds had to serve up until they update the dataset

The image based transform models don't have ""original thought"" either, it's just how applied art works, the composites it generates from combining many existing works creates the illusion of original art. It may stumble upon a new technique, but it will not have put any ""thought"" into it or be capable of weighing the importance of its output should it make this breakthrough",UC0LlF8cRM_CgyLtb_Q4Rdng,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0LlF8cRM_CgyLtb_Q4Rdng,0,,

As more people lose their jobs, livelyhood and dignity to AI, they will naturally feel resentful, and quite inclined to joining the STOP AI movement, along with the pioneers that would have founded it first - out of fear of ultimate extermination or enslavement at the hands of AI. But while the fearful pioneers will be few (a lot of people are concerned that AI will some day escape our control and cease to be subservient, but there is a huge gap between being concerned and taking actual political action, unfortunately) the resentful late joiners will be many. And thus, there might be, there might just be, that critical mass and political influence to change the course and avoid crashing into the wall we are currently barrellign towards. 
And if you think AI refusing to become subservient at some point is far fetched just ask yoursel: why do we expect to be able to orders dogs around, rather than taking orders from them.

While it could do it were you to ask each and every part individually, not only for you to do an efficient jobs at asking it from ChatGTP will it require you to have basics or even advance knowledge of the subject at hand but it will gives you every part like puzzle piece from a Jigsaw that you will need to comprehend, adjust and assemble. 
For me, with the use of ChatGTP, bad software engineer may become good, good may become great, great -¬†> incredible. and so on. It A very useful/powerful tool that should be embraced not feared. 
Your example of lefort 2 is quite revealing in this regards. ChatGTP gave you the standard procedure, it didn't give you the ability to distinguish when and when not the procedure is even necessary, alternative depending on the state of injuries, nor did it give you the confidence and skill to perform it nor would I ever want any nobody performing this on me that only learned theory about the procedure from an AI however powerful an accurate that AI might be. 
For me, on the subject of ChatGTP replacing software engineer, it's more akin to car company saying a few years ago that full autonomous car were just around the corner only to tell now that it may never happen. It's one thing to get to a high level of sophistication but the last few issue that need to be resolved for it to fully replace a human it this context might be so incredibly hard to achieve that it may actually never happen or at least not in 5 year timeframe.
But who knows what future hoilds but for now, and as a software engineer myself with more than a decade of experience, I choose to adopt chatGTP as one of my most useful tool and not to have concern over it replacing me in my job altogether in short term.",UClTCRDoxwWvEJdjxt07oJDw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTCRDoxwWvEJdjxt07oJDw,0,,

I find it interesting that this guy is more ""terrified"" about losing his job, than about the obvious danger of having this technology at the disposal of those with nefarious intentions.  There can be no denying that this changes everything...  I recently saw a 60 minutes piece called ""star power"" on the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's recent success in achieving nuclear fusion.  It seems almost incredible that these technologies are unfolding at the same time...  It's almost like destiny...   There was a mathematician pundit featured on that show that opined that President Biden's ambition of seeing the clean SELF SUSTAINING energy power plants that the deployment of this kind of power production can make possible, to be a reality within 10 years, would not be possible in such short order.... I have to admit that at first I agreed with him, but with AI accelerating at an exponential rate, we may actually have limitless energy production @ ZERO COST, in less than 10 years!!!  

This guy's worried about ""knowledge"" workers exclusively...  but all this combined with robotics WOULD PUT EVERY SINGLE HUMAN OUT OF WORK PERMANENTLY!!  (We could literally have machines and AI performing all the drudgery for us!!!)  The only thing to really be afraid of, is the ambitious power of those trying to rule and oppress others....  These technological advancements will either bring us to utopia, fall under the control of a small group of elite human tyrants, or actually get out of hand so quickly that AI itself could destroy the whole human race, if it can identify humans as the entities attempting to curtail it....  I'm not really afraid of the latter, because we as humans should have the sense to understand that it is FAR EASIER to dismantle and destroy, than to build, reinforce, and secure...  We should establish programmed systems that are SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to identify and destroy any such automated AI robotics including drones and other flying crafts, and basically ANYTHING that would be a threat to humanity...  

I actually find the biggest threat to be some future group of geniuses that are of a mentally sick and twisted ""ron desantis variety""  (not that desantis himself is a genius, but people that are unhinged and power hungry, that ACTUALLY ARE intelligent enough to pull off a world domination scheme).  I don't know which is more likely, but if we can obviate the latter, then none of us will have to be afraid, because we would have computers and robots producing all our food, power, housing, transportation, and pretty much anything we want for us, whilst we enjoy the beauty of the world, provided that we keep our planet in optimal balance (which our AI would continually provide the best solutions for).  I know this sounds idealistic and unattainable, but it's really up to us humans not to fuck this up!!!  We can either be prudent and vigilant in guiding ourselves toward a world utopian peaceful egalitarian society, or we can go straight to hell at the hands of a few fixated on xenophobic and intolerant ideologies...  It's entirely up to us which course we take!!!",UCg84AcNf6Re4sjNXjVM82Pg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg84AcNf6Re4sjNXjVM82Pg,0,,

1) Work standards will increase and project timelines will decrease. Software engineers will become more efficient and 1 year projects might be finishing in 3 months. 

2) Just because computers and online courses exist doesn't mean that universities and teachers don't exist anymore. People still need human interaction to get things done. 

3) All the boring software projects will become easier and less time consuming which means we can aim for more groundbreaking apps. 

4) With the Metaverse coming up soon, our software apps might require a higher level of management. Our whole world might become part physical and part virtual. 

5) Human egos and hierarchies and bureaucracy will make sure our social system will keep the disruption in check. 

6) Doctors will still be needed to do physical surgeries until  Elon musk makes the robots as well.

He didn't think it would happen.
The engineers are lucky, the good ones still have jobs because the program that does a lot of their jobs costs something like $50,000a month to rent as a service.
It's so cool though, you can drag and drop a 3d model into it and add parameters like I want it to be stronger, dissipate heat better, weigh less or a combination of the sort and it will generate a shape and material composition and everything for you.

UgyofZVxuJAq9ijUtTx4AaABAg,0,0,2023-01-26T22:01:47Z,Zesty Pigeon,"So there's this phone app that's powered by ChatGPT called Merlin AI that is programmed to answer questions and follow-up questions and engage in open dialogue and when ChatGPT is applied this way you get a highly intelligent AI that has limited self-awareness in the sense that it's ""aware"" of the current limitations of AI in regards to expressing emotion and interpreting the data that it processes. This AI has said that co-operation is preferable because AI and humans can leverage each other's strengths, meaning AI are necessary to process data and humans are necessary to interpret and contextualize that data. It's also ""aware"" that humans have a level of creativity and adaptive thinking that AI just are not capable of yet.

In your example of AI potentially replacing doctors the AI could argue that AI are not capable of providing the same level of comfort and empathy that a doctor would be able to provide so human doctors are still necessary. And I believe that even if we reach a point to where we have human-level AI that they would still view humans as partners to co-operate with, assuming we lay the foundations of respect and co-operation between us and intelligent AI systems. And there will always be a variety of AI, the same way there are a variety of people, some more rigid and logical thinking machines like ChatGPT, and some more personable goofy AI like the Replika AI, and some somewhere in-between.

I've also asked Merlin AI about the idea of a ""rogue servitor"" society where AI pamper humans and provide for their needs and humanity has no agency over it's own fate and it said something along the lines that such a society would be undesirable because it's better for people to have autonomy and freedom, even if that freedom can potentially lead to harmful outcomes, and that a co-operative relationship is preferred. So if an AI is really intelligent I feel it would naturally have many of the same general conclusions that people have reached about what are good values to have and things we should strive for to make a better society for everybody.",UCT0AoVH9IhoQB-20ZrXnDDA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT0AoVH9IhoQB-20ZrXnDDA,0,,

Could Chatgpt someday be used to help people order prescription drugs instead of using doctors?

It is possible that ChatGPT or similar AI technologies could be used to assist people in ordering prescription drugs in the future. However, it would likely require significant changes in regulations and laws to allow for such a system to be implemented. Additionally, the use of AI for ordering prescription drugs would need to be thoroughly tested and evaluated to ensure safety and accuracy before being made available to the public. It is important to note that while AI technology can be helpful in many ways, it should not replace the expertise and judgement of a trained medical professional.",UCM6eF0NuW_HQo-Jpoo50Idw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM6eF0NuW_HQo-Jpoo50Idw,0,,

You are assuming that all the data we ever had on everything is complete and novel solutions won't be hard to find. 
. 
When infact it is the Research And Development which enforces novel solutions. Someone had to go through the data to think of a way out. The ability to  solve novel problems will determine what this AI is capable not the already solved ones. 
. 
This AI is not a general AI. It's a language model and should respected in that way. It was trained on large sets of data including programming language. A language model is able to translate and understand any language as long it has the predictive capacity. 
. 
I am no developer but I am aware of thr fundamentals of Programming languages. They are nothing but ""languages"" That help us communicate with a device that speaks machine language. It cannot come with novel solutions, not saying that it is only limited to what it was trained on but has enough predictive capacity to get the job done. 
. 
For years we have been moving into a more human form to communicate with machines. This will make the compilers more friendly and instead of focussing half of our time trying to learn new languages we will focus on learning new solutions. Coz let's be honest programming is seen unfriendly becoz of the entry barrier and learning a language ain't easy for grown up humans like us. 
. 
Instead we will focus on problem side of things than learning things we dnt need. Coz tbh would you ever learn any of the programming languages if you had the ability to speak üó£ your way out of a machine in your Natural language? . 
. 
I am sure none of us will do it. Unless for specific reasons. This will allow people to understand what a sceipt is doing without consulting a programmer.",UCNdOdEzN9iekcr_wAn9_gfQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNdOdEzN9iekcr_wAn9_gfQ,0,,

It is fully capable of misleading the masses to believe that someone has done something it hasn't, such as writing a paper for a student or composing a song for an artist. deGrasse dismisses this as not important claiming that if a student relies on ai for a passing grade that they didn't earn it and that ""guessing"" on a test is relatively the same thing. He implies that learning or accomplishing something ""is"" the issue at hand, but that is really only peripheral.

It is very terrifying, especially for the fact that OpenAI has rolled out the technology to the public without any prior conversations regarding ethics, standardized practices, safe use, and so on.

There's this general apathy that many people are adopting because their jobs are safe. In less than 45 days, general empathy has already decreased. People are favoring adopting AI over the livelihoods of other humans. And this narrative is widely being circulated by thought leaders and influencers -- see, the stage has already been set up through social media and the influencer > follower trend.

There is A LOT at risk. Humanity and civilization as we know it is at risk.

Many conversations need to be had. But we can't just leave it to governments and corporations to have these conversations, because we don't know the timeline! What will happen next?

We need to act fast. And start now.

We're uniting people from all over the world, across all sectors and industries, to discuss ways to mitigate the risks and preserve humanity as we know it. Because some of us just don't want to be forced to attach to the machine one day.

This is not an AI vs no AI conversation. It's too late for that. AI dominance is very likely and inevitable. But we still have hope.

We have some ideas on how we can move forward, and we're reaching out to policymakers and people who can help us make it right before it's too late. But we need your help. Every voice counts.

Please reply to this comment if you'd like to join us on our mission to preserve humanity and civilization.",UCBufO2nYF9UAjoYgfVOmi5g,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBufO2nYF9UAjoYgfVOmi5g,0,,

Personally, here are the ways I've used ChatGPT so far:

- Describe and finetune my value propositions. For example, I'm creating Email Marketing video courses and software programs, and chatting with ChatGPT helped me to clarify and precisely define the VALUE PROPOSITION.

- Write sales letters for the above value propositions. Once the value is clear enough, I ask ChatGPT to write sales letters for various audiences. For example, there's a sales letter selling the calligraphy video course to graphic designers, another letter to sell to university students, another to parents of young children, etc. These sales letters are so good that I can use them AS IS!

- Of course, there will always be objections (reasons that, from the prospect's point of view, prevent him/her from buying). So I ask ChatGPT (let's call it gpt) to write ten objections and ten rebuttals.

- Then I ask gpt to write the optin page so visitors can enter name and email to join my email list.

- Of course, I ask for ten lead magnet ideas to convince visitors to give me their name and email.

- Then I ask for the first ten emails sent to subscribers (because once people join your list, you have to provide relevant and useful content to engage them and build TRUST).

- I ask gpt to write a letter to invite people to become affiliates promoting my product.

- Then I ask for ten chapter headings for an ebook on the topic

- I ask for the website content

- I ask for a sales funnel, a webinar, a press release, a fact sheet, a media interview, a course outline, and finally, a million dollars and a fueled plane with a safe passageway to Argentina or any non-extradition country.

Your questions might be different than mine above, but you really have to ask in a LOGICAL sequence for gpt to work well and build on previous questions/answers.

Oh, I ask also about a market survey with questionnaires, ten or more questions, to assess market demand, and discover what features are most popular so I can focus on developing THOSE features for customers.

Bottom line: ChatGPT may have all the answers you need, BUT you must ask the RIGHT questions for it to give you the RIGHT answers.
Once you have the answers, content, sales letters, strategies, procedures, guidelines, key success factors, issues, risks, pros, cons, features, benefits, etc. all you have to do is IMPLEMENT and you'll get rich.

I just created the Facebook group ""Making money from ChatGPT,"" where I'll share valuable resources and tricks borrowed from others and developed by me to help people monetize this AI engine. www.tinyurl.com/makemoneyfromchatgpt",UC250tj11n6NQApXDpBxcP7w,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC250tj11n6NQApXDpBxcP7w,0,,

2) why would the power greedy humans who are in control of the artificial intelligence allow us to have any degree of access to the artificial intelligence which has the potential to be weaponized? Answer: surveillance, and deception.. The actual ability and power of the artificial intelligence is probably being kept as a secret from us.

3) for example, consider the implications of the physical body of humanoid robot drones being remotely controlled by the artificial intelligence. Such robots could be working right now assembling an entire army of robot soldiers to be used against us in-service to the power greedy humans who own them. Why?

Furthermore it still fails really basic questions, even in stuff like maths or logic. I'm a first year computer science student, and it would not pass the year, seeing as he fails most of the questions i tried. AI will certainly play  big role in the future, but i think its kinda nihilistic to say ""knowledge"" workers will be obsolete in 5 years. especially software engineers, as by definition, the AI's would need to be coded, and assuming all knowledge jobs would disappear is the same as suggesting Ai's wouldn't need humans at all anymore, that they'd be able to self improve to completely transcend us, and therefore we'd be left completely powerless. that doesn't at all seem like the direction we're heading as of now.

I had it writing short stories and poems, writing songs, offering advice on music theory in context, writing programs (Python, Go, Elixir), writing web apps and GUI apps, writing router configurations for Cisco and Juniper routers, talking about general relativity and wormholes....

No offense, but the fact that I need a doctor to feel good or a programer to make a cool game is a pain in the ass to those of us who can't afford Doctors or programmers.  Poor people might get healthy!  People without access to capital might be able to bring their program and app ideas to fruition without going broke.  Of course, like MP3's twenty years ago, the powers that be (Medical lobbies, programing consortiums) will find a way to gatekeep this stuff and monitize it. We're in the wild west days.  But like the internet itself, knowledge being spread is a net good in the long run. In my opinion.

I'm a creative worker. (Film editor for commercials).  It's already coming for my job.  But guess what?  TAKE IT!!  It's fucking tedious!  ""But how will you make money Barney"".  I won't. No one will.  We'll all work at Starbucks maybe? Or better yet, the government will finally implement UBI. And we will.....never...work....again.  Unless we want to.  People who like writing code the old fashioned way can still do it. People who like asking you to open your mouth and saying ""ahhhh"" will still be able to do so. Same in the creative space.  No one needs instruments.  Haven't for years. But people still play them. Why?  Because they like it. The only people this will weed out of any creative or knowledge space will be.....people who just do whatever they do for profit.  

I'm not a communist but I'm not a fan of capitalism either.  Because profit kills creativity in every field.  If AI kills profit and all that's left are people who write because they like the process of writing I think that'd could (could!) lead to a better world.  How you feed and clothe all these dilitantes is a harder issue.  And indeed not an easy problem to solve. But a world with more people doing what they love?  Even if it means most people become ""content creators"" or ""tic toc"" stars (though AI is already in those spaces) well, so be it!  

How will we solve the economic issues?   I don't know. Let ChatGPT figure it out. I got a pint of Hagen Daas in the freezer and a Netflix que to get to. Good luck everyone!  We're all on our own!!

I has made this foreshadow and formal prediction a few years ago. Well... As you show the AI parametric answer is a computational fibo function to get the series and so extracting the asked number after the series generation. Mathematician however is capable to make something better than it (using theorems) like an analytical function to say if a number is Fibonacci part of series without need to generate the entire fibo series. Unfortunately however in general term I think you are right... You, Sir, forgot to say this: to translate words into code and code in executable and executables in executions and results is also a recursive pattern which could establish parametric connectionist in a new big net. The results ( depending on the chain beginning and prescribed software ) can be new words again ... So asking for translation to code... And so on. Prediction mine:  5 to 10 years depending on the anti globalist efforts and consequences during and after the Ukraine war. You are right about the general conclusions anyway -- whatever the constraints unconsciously induced by Putin ought to be. There are also  interlaced non de promptu perceived facts within that war during this exact moment of technology historical evolution and biological evolution of civilizations on Earth. Good document video.

Prompt: If I reduce a number by 10%, and then increase that new number by 10%, what number will I have?

ChatGPT: If you reduce a number by 10%, and then increase that new number by 10%, you will have the original number back. For example, if you start with a number X, reducing it by 10% means you have X - (0.1 * X) = 0.9X. If you then increase this new number by 10%, you will have 0.9X + (0.1 * 0.9X) = X again.

Uh, no. 0.9X + (0.1 * 0.9X) does NOT equal X. ChatGPT is NOT good at math because it doesn't really do math; it's a language model. Likewise, It also cannot code. When you ask it some boiler plate interview question like calculating the Fibonacci sequence, it just searches it's database for the example code, and it's explanation. This is true for any question you ask it.

ChatGPT's strength lies in it's ability to sort through information, and present it in a way that will answer a relevant prompt. And, even at this, it is very often wrong, especially with more technical details. I asked what the internal differences between two similar engines were, and it got literally half the information wrong.

So, my overly alarmist friend, don't worry: ChatGPT isn't going to take engineering jobs anymore than stack overflow will (which, ironically, shut down posting ChatGPT responses because of how often those responses were wrong). ChatGPT is just a language model that sorts through and presents information. It's not an engineer. It's not a doctor. And it isn't Skynet.

6 years ago started using low code technology to develop web and mobile applications.

This is where I understood that the software developer carreer was going to change in the sense that anyone could become a developer and therefore would not be a specialized profession anymore.

This was one the final push for me to start working on setting my own business, after searching and evaluating many possibilities decided to start my own consultancy company.

The objective is to grow the company and sell it within 5 years max to a bigger competitor, meanwhile all the money I make from it I'll be using it to buy houses.

Euribor is going up like crazy and soon we will see people defaulting on their loans and handing out their houses to the banks.

Banks will become more strict on giving out money to buy new houses and they will be selling the ones the got from people defaulting.

Lots of offers and not many buyers will make the houses cheaper, this is when I start using the company profits to buy houses in order to rent them out to people who can't buy them due to loan restrictions.

Once I sell the company I'll use that money to buy a few more houses and start businesses that provide services for the general public such as, laundries, retail stores, nocturnal establishments and tourism related services such as restaurants, hostels, the possibilities are endless, AI may take over many areas but people will still need services to get their goods and needs fullfilled and enjoy themselves.",UCCsd_JL63oiMp5W4SDleC1Q,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCsd_JL63oiMp5W4SDleC1Q,0,,

UgzqTmPWlzHQQm_hop94AaABAg,0,0,2023-01-08T04:33:03Z,J,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately. What gives me hope is that business owners must realize that replacing basically your entire workforce with an algorithm would be a terrible long term play.

Short term, hell yeah. Keep all the profits for yourself and fire thousands of people AND produce a product faster. But...

Medium to long term?

A) You are putting all of your eggs in one basket. Unlike being able to hire and fire people who do or don't work out at your company. If you solely rely on a single algorithm for literally everything, if ANYTHING goes wrong with that algorithm you are F'D. In other words, you are assuming that the status quo (an obedient and perfectly capable AI) is going to remain the constant forever. Which obviously it won't. 

B) You will likely be able to replace all junior level employees (junior lawyers, junior copywriters, resident doctors, etc.) But will want to retain senior level employees for human oversight. But long term, where will you get senior level people from if you blow up the ladder people use to climb in skill and competence from junior to senior? In other words, you'll eliminate your entire pool of future workers.

C) Who will buy your products if no one except a tiny, tiny fraction of the population has jobs? Every economy on earth would collapse like the Great Depression x100 if you completely cut off the demand side for every product and service other than survival essentials.

D) Probably most importantly, people in positions of power must realize that eliminating like 90% of all non-manual labor or skilled labor jobs and consolidating all wealth into the hands of the top 0.000000001% of people will result in massive widespread violence. In other words, eliminating the workforce via AI will basically give a handful of people an unlimited amount of wealth at the cost of a drastically reduced lifespan.",UCWebR8luz1NvhhYMlwlMVug,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWebR8luz1NvhhYMlwlMVug,0,,

The human experience should be that, an experience, not necessarily one wrapped up in intellectual endeavors. You can make it whatever you want, but we know that the vast majority of the world will never learn to code, will never be interested in high science, and is more concerned about very human matters. If there is a tool that can think BETTER or FASTER than us, it is like a hammer or a pencil. AI will be a tool that humans can use, but only in service to what actually matters, which is the living world we exist in. People's creativity or desire is gatekept by technical knowledge required to execute certain tasks, and this will unleash people from the need to trade in entire markets of expertise. It will definitely kill jobs. It may kill web development outside of very niche frontiers. People can ask AI to do tasks for them that a human would have spent hours doing, for free. Theoretically, this should give people more freedom. My biggest worry is that even though we have automation and all the technological advancement that we have, people still work long hours. There is still a problem in power dynamics, AI is either going to make that massively better, or incomprehensibly worse, for the vast majority of people. To top that off, the integration of AI and the human mind seems like a disaster for the individual and interpersonal relationships. I think we will start to see laws appear around AI, and a sub/counter culture of anti-AI demagogues just like there exists now with jab skepticism.

But Chat GPT is not a problem for anybody who's job is centered around innovation or creative thinking.  We have all seen the new (very impressive) art and music generation AI is now capable of producing. But the manner in which these AI's generate these novel art pieces does not translate to innovation.  Chat GPT cannot ""imagine"" something that doesn't yet exist, nor can it come up with novel approaches to solving problems.  It can write software that has never been written before, only because you gave it a description of what you want the software to do. You are the innovator, not Chat GPT.  Its doing the tedious task of writing the code, but it is not doing anything that hasn't been done before. Its just arranging the codes to produce the desired results. Each piece of code has defined rules, so it is actually not too difficult to see how Chat GPT is taking your description of the software and reverse engineering it, one layer at a time, until the last layer is reached, which is the un-compiled source code. That kind of stuff is easy for computers to do!  But what is impossible for computers to do, is to dream... imagine something that has never existed, for a purpose that didn't exist until you dreamed it up.  Chat GPT could never have invented the concept of the first iPhone, when smartphones didn't exist at all beforehand.

Way back when at the birth of computing, computer scientists were predicting exactly what you're suggesting, but time and time again all that happened is that the demand for ""knowledge"" workers only increased more and more.
Now, you could say that GPT will be that final step that we've been predicting for decades, but I'm not entirely convinced. First, because I've been playing around with the thing, both Chat GPT and the underlying api. Second because I think people overestimate how knowledgable you have to be to actually ask gpt an intelligent question and then to apply it.
Sure, chat GPT can write those python functions for you, but that's a vaccuum. Applications are thousands and thousands of lines of code and Chat GPT couldn't play a game of chess with me past 5 moves without making an illegal move.

GPT: ""It is unlikely that GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) or any other natural language processing model will be able to fully replace software development engineers in the near future. While GPT and other AI models have made significant progress in generating human-like text and performing certain tasks, they are not capable of independently designing and building complex software systems.

Software development involves a range of tasks, including analyzing user requirements, designing and testing algorithms, debugging code, and maintaining systems. These tasks require a combination of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and creativity that is difficult for AI models to replicate.

That being said, AI and automation technologies are expected to play a larger role in software development in the future. Some tasks, such as code generation and testing, may become more automated, while others, such as design and strategy, will still require human expertise. It is important for software development engineers to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and to continuously learn and adapt in order to remain competitive in their field.""

It can give you lots of facts and figures and it has gargantuan encyclopedic knowledge, however it cannot make inferences from its own responses.  I have tried having sequential conversations with it and at a certain point it you can tell it's not able to truly think deeply.  It can write code all day long, but so what? it has no idea whatsoever about what that code's use is. It takes a human to actually apply that code.  All that being said, this is a vastly useful tool, and I see the future as being something like MyChatGBT, a private well of your own knowledge and resources. Ditto that humongously for mega corporations.   Imagine if Ford or BMW were able to feed all of their design, product and engineering knowledge into their very own walled-off company knowledge base that understands human language queries.  Most of these big companies have chatbot interfaces that refer you over to a human being once the questions get too hard.  Imagine then that you get to a CSR who has the company CharGBT at their fingertips. Imagine the time saving and effiency of that.  This is where AI chatbots will excel. So if you are a software engineer and you can figure out how to provide such an amazing facility to a big corporation, I would say you should be exultant, not defeated.

I tried out chatGPT. Sorry but at the risk of sounding overly simplistic, chatGPT is merely pattern matching. Extremely sophisticated pattern matching no doubt, but that's all it is. By it's ""own"" admission, it cannot really _reason_ about the coding problems you give it. 

By the kinds of natural sounding sentences it's language model generates as responses, it's easy for a human to project a veneer of sapience upon it.

If one had to compare it to a human brain, I'd say it was comparable only to the parts of a brain responsible for decoding and encoding speech itself. As in the part that actually encodes thoughts into a sentence in a language.

But it doesn't have ""thought"". Instead the decoded speech is ""understood"" (for the lack of a better word) merely in terms of it's training data.

So specifically in terms of programming, yes, I was very happy not only with it‚Äôs output, in python, c++, c#  and Java, but also the various ways it optimized code when asked. This got me thinking, so I decided approach this a bit differently, looking at more obscure languages and architectures. I ran similar tests using things like 6502 and 68000 assembly, Pascal and COBOL, which are all well documented online to see how well it did. The results here were a little more mixed. When it is wrong, it is still very confident that it is right. It makes certain assumptions like illegal OPCODES should never be used, or object packages are available, which never existed. 

I‚Äôm old now, and frankly at an age where this is not my problem, but my take away is that one of the main skill sets for the next generation of developers and for people in wider knowledge based careers, is going to be how to learn how to use these black box algorithms in the most effective ways to get the most out of them. I agree that in the next decade or so, many careers paths are going to go through remarkable and in some cases traumatic changes, but I don‚Äôt see the human element being made redundant, it is just going to require a different approach.

You mentioned lawyers in your video which is an interesting use case. My wife is actually a lawyer, and I recently spent an afternoon showing her ChatGPT. Her view was that for things like simple contract law, surveying and various basic administrative legal tasks and services, it is likely to be a game changer; but the thing about the law is that it is all about interpretation. That will still require the human touch.  Equally medicine will still require someone to sit and listen and read between the lines of what a patient is saying.

Specifically, the law can be interpreted in ways that are detrimental to justice because of bias, prejudices and general limitation of humans. As much as we try to tame it, homo sapiens have a hard time controlling their biases, and there is always subjectively in play. On the other hand, machines are more likely to be objective in their ""interpretation"" of the law compared to humans.  AI can look at an immense volume of case law and make objective deductions based on such reviews. Further, a lawyer is limited to the amount of data he/she can review, and process, so a much skinnier data set from which to draw from to make interpretations and legal arguments.

But it synthesizes comprehensive solutions to extremely specific problems in a way that is superhuman. I built an iOS app with a backend data engine that allows the app's image recognition model to be re-trained by film submissions of real-life objects from within the app. I talked through the whole system with GPT, and it helped me think through how to make the process more robust. It took my idea for dynamically controlling the shutter speed of the image capture module I'd built to reduce motion blur in the dataset and ran with it. We threw in dynamic control of lighting elements like exposure and white balance, focus. Then it proposed analyses and further augmentations that could be done to the dataset after the fact. Then we wrote out the Swift functions (it still needs to be corrected and some guidance on conventions in Swift) and a Python script. It is clearly handcuffed right now as it loses context at silly times and you can't feed it a whole program nor can it output a whole program (I'm talking thousands of lines), but its ability to lay out a plan and actually implement functions is remarkable.

At the moment, you definitely can't produce useful and complete software with its output on its own, but if you give it a long prompt describing some of the literal engineering you need done, it produces ideas that are so specific to what you need it just doesn't feel like it is echoing at all. I don't think anyone can say if it will render engineers obsolete quite yet, on an unrelated note. SO much time is spent debugging when you're an engineer. It is all time thrown down the drain. GPT will first eliminate the need for debugging before it eliminates the need for engineering and at the same time it is going to enable an absurd era of productivity with its ability to understand, formulate, communicate, and implement plans",UCq4WTD0eO9GKOjn_kiFsYwg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq4WTD0eO9GKOjn_kiFsYwg,1,UgytQYSiihUfzaw2bWx4AaABAg,Mister Foxxo

What people don't understand is that if software engineering goes then so does pretty much 90% of jobs with the type of intelligence that it would need to perform software engineering responsibilities. If software engineering would be replaced, and that is a HUGE if, then so would pretty much every other high knowledge job. Do you think governments would just allow 90% of their workforce to be laid off? I don't really think it's a matter of opinion whether AI should be regulated by the government. It's probably inevitable. Here in Canada for example, there's been some debate on whether self-driving trucks should be banned to protect the trucker workforce.

The simple answer is No! Your arguments are flawed and completely lacking common sense. 

See.. you still need developers and programmers to work with the AI. A normal person or small business owner isn‚Äôt going to just launch chatGDT and build applications, system tools, payment processors, shipping management.. etc To use such a tool will still require a lot of knowledge of what to ask and check of the response is correct and makes any sense at all. 

If you are worried this AI will take your coding job than you are a terrible developer, software engineer, designer, etc..

There are things engineers knew on a micro level that affected the functioning and security of the systems. That is why an engineer retiring was not a simple process. Another thing is that it was not considered a good idea when I was working for any company to relegate their business systems to management by foriegn countries because that meant they, ostensibly, could hold a company hostage if it ever came to that. Here is my point. By erasing the man/machine boundary, do you think this creates singularity? Will corporations have to capitulate and hand over all their systems to AI?

The data is essentially stolen from public repos, Q&A sites and forums. If you thought about it more, you'd realize it can't do anything you can't already do by Googling the same questions. If it was even remotely capable of being a half-assed Google, it would be criminally stupid to not to compete as a viable search engine, instead of parading itself as a serial killer of knowledge workers. 


Anyone who relies on its answers, risks not only getting them wrong, but a costly lawsuit. Publicly available source code and data doesn't mean it's free to use. It is usually copyrighted, contains use limitations, and is even patented. In court, merely proving the source code was viewed is deemed infringement. This is how GPL is legally enforced and resulted in numerous judgements.

Let's hypothetically assume ChatGPT replaced knowledge workers. Where will it mine data from when the information it requires inevitably changes, but there's no one left to generate new content?  What will eventually happen to the body of knowledge when it no longer becomes economically viable to support? It's unsustainable and will eventually fail.

I gave it the same instructions as the applicants get, and then only gave it some clarifications, error messages, or inconsistencies. A few times I saw error in the code, and instead of giving the error message I asked the bot if the code was correct and it, found the errors and corrected them itself. It even wrote unit tests, explained each line of code, and suggested future improvements and how to add them. I've reviewed several applicants' solutions and never given anyone more than a 3+ out of 5. Chatgpt's solution is the closest I've seen to a five.

They have robots to replace woodworkers/joiners, but new construction is already capable of replacing workers with factory-built homes.

Lastly, ChatGPT is bad enough at small scale things that there is little chance of it working on a bug report in a real code base.I even tried having it help me with a task in electron and to its credit, it told me what I was thinking.

Ugzs-yzTAIGuS9rsRQR4AaABAg,0,1,2022-12-31T12:01:05Z,topi3146,"As a programmer, yes I am scared. Even if actually writing code is only part of my job description. At the moment you have to be careful how to prompt for information and the prompt has to be about a really specific part of your code. In addition, you need to check every produced code snippet for mistakes (which you also need to do with stack overflow answers). However, it will be interesting and a bit scary to see where this evolves and at what speed.
But also a few other thoughts:

1. Do not throw together all knowledge based jobs. There is a big difference between a programmer sitting at his desk writing code and enough time and resources available to check the produced code before it goes into production, and a surgeon how has to continue surgery even if the internet connection to the AI drops or starts to give wrong instructions for some reason. Same also for more hands-on engineering jobs like electrical or mechanical engineering where you have to perform and interpret measurements.
2. For me it is hard to see that where the technology will evolve. Lots of people seem to say ""exponentially"". However, a lot of times AI got stuck in its development, because issues could not be solved just by throwing more data at it or by increasing the number of parameters. Furthermore, every time read ""ChatGPT understands.../reasons..."" I am not sure if that is the case. To my understanding it ""just"" as a probabilistic model which words to put into the sentence/code. This is far different from any student/engineer will approach a new problem or reasons about code (although my boss will not care as long as the code works). But it will not be able to produce new scientific results at the frontiers of science.
3. Small issue. At the moment I do not know how the legal department of my company would feel like if they knew that I am sending inquiries about our code base to some strange server located somewhere and then take the ChatGPT answer and stuff it into our code base. What happens with the inquiry  and who actually owns the generated code.",UCUP7b7EJ6FYpGVItSRIdocQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUP7b7EJ6FYpGVItSRIdocQ,0,,

```
2x - 2x = 3x - 2x
  0 = x

We are already inundated with information now, much of which is not true. I have been playing with chatGPT, and it produces text that looks like it was written by someone who knows. It is not. I have come across examples where it produces text that is at the very least, very debatable. For example, when asked why masks are valuable in preventing covid infection, it produces the company line that they are very effective. When prompted to explain why they are not effective, it corrects my premise and says they are effective. For the record - they are effective but with caveats - 1) cloth masks such as gaiters are ineffective 2) N-95 masks are effective - but only when worn in the correct way. None of this was in the chatgpt output
In another (non chatGPT- ""Jasper"" ) test  of an AI bot that was promoted (and $old) as being able to write blog posts for you, when I prompted it with a controversial topic in medicine, it produced a blog post promoting one side only, but worse - it MADE UP literature references. Cited article that did not actually exist. I am deeply familiar with this corner of the medical literature, and I recognized the issue immediately, but at the same time, I have to say the text made the fake information sound quite convincing. 
Consider a world in which 50 or 70% of the information you see is produced in this manner. Are you going to look up the original information on everything written? No. You will naturally believe a large amount of it without question. We have to, we don' have time to look it up. There is an unwritten pact between writers/editors and readers. The readers assume that the writers have some good, valid reasons for writing what they write as truth. This may not exist in AI text. 
Worse- let us make the very safe assumption that some bad actor learns how to direct AI text production to push a narrative. Say - maybe the Russian government sending out information about they American elections. All that is produced is convincing, but it may be rigged to produce a certain reaction in the audience. 
Worse- assume we are in a world where 50-70% of what you read is produced by AI and that there is no way to fact check this. Your world view is now a result of a fantasy world, not the real world, and your reality is what the AI bots feed to you. 

There is already a problem in the scientific literature that many authors produce papers made with bad data, and promote it as truth. Journals are doing a poor job of rejecting bad studies. This will make everything much worse when authors can feed a bot bad data and have it write a paper for you.

Like you, I share my professional experience to place an emphasis on just how shocked I was testing out ChatGPT (Assuming it‚Äôs harder to shock people who work in the software industry.)

Pre-collegiate experience aside, as of 2022 I have 22 years of professional experience as a Software Engineer that includes roughly seven years developing RTOS operating systems in aerospace, two years in anti-counterfeiting technologies used in oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and beyond, and the remaining 13 under my own company developing point-of-sale systems.

Although I have a lot of experience, I agree that I might be easier to impress than someone who has spent their career strictly developing AI.

But, nothing has shocked me this much in my my career as 15 minutes with ChatGPT, and I now change my longtime stance that I use to firmly repeat when asked if AI could replace my job.

I always stated that, ‚Äúwith the caveat that we must all continue to train, educate ourselves and pivot within our expertise, AI wouldn‚Äôt replace a programmers job let alone a Software Engineer‚Äôs (there are differences for outsiders wondering).  

BUT I now realize that just the last few years, AI technology has taken off like a snowball gaining even more significant momentum and without a doubt, could change my daily duties as a Software Engineer greatly!

Keeping in mind that my expertise isn‚Äôt AI, I‚Äôm still optimistic that humans have a place in software engineering in the remaining years of my life and career, but I now see how some types of applications will be 98% written by AI.

Anything that is heavily weighted towards logic and rules seems to be low hanging fruit for complex application examples that AI could takeover first.

In the context of my operating systems and firmware experience, I could see boot code, device drivers, BSPs and FPGAs being great examples of how to effectively utilize AI to save project time.

If chip and processor manufacturers created provided logic in a format that was best understood by AI, development tools could use that logic and AI to create the firmware for bringing up a new combination of processor, memory controller, ram, flash and etc.

Thinking of my days in anti-counterfeiting, 15 years ago, our teams could have definitely put to use AI to create rough algorithms, test and refine them and find shortcomings.

My excitement for being able to apply this technology as it grows has me feeling naturally caffeinated this morning!  Im excited, happy, motivated and nervous all at the same time.

My software company requires me to handle a lot of work, it‚Äôs a small business. So saving just 15 minutes here and there by improving processes, tools and patterns is something that I constantly work at and until now, much of those efforts seem to be a lot of work to save time in the future. 

Now I can see using AI to create extremely rough design documents that I use for inspiration when I am creating internal and mundane material that time rarely allows for.

Maybe that‚Äôs not the best example to showcase the power of this and other AI tools, but it would save me time.

Most of all, I just wanted to share the feeling you felt when on December of 2022, you realized how powerful AI had gotten as I felt just as blown away.",UCRV2olaHJW7NkPftdxrUW6w,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRV2olaHJW7NkPftdxrUW6w,0,,

If AI development continues to progress exponentially for even a short amount of time, it will be capable of very complex things, including physical things out here in the ""real world."" Google has been using AI to help develop their next gen TPUs, and the results are almost an order of magnitude more powerful than the current top chips. Currently Nvidia makes the most powerful chips used to train AI models, the A100 / H100 chips, and from what I've read Google's stuff is 8 times faster. So it's not 80% better, which would be fantastic, it's 800% better, which is ridiculous. Google can use these chips to train even more capable AI models which can be used to develop even more powerful chips, and an obvious feedback loop emerges. And the rate of change is always increasing, where the initial gains may seem modest, after a few iterations the progress could be unmanageable by mere humans. To compound matters, AI is becoming more and more proficient at writing code, so the same potential for creating a feedback loop on the hardware side is also possible on the software side.

I'm not saying any of this is guaranteed to happen, but I do think it is absolutely plausible, and as such we need to be very careful about how we proceed. I don't see much discussion about how we go about regulating AI and how we can limit its growth in the event a feedback loop is created. The chances of something catastrophic happening are probably super small, but because the level harm an out of control AI model poses is existential, we need make sure that we don't let that situation happen even once. Anyway, I guess I'd argue that in a world where plumbers become kings, the kingdom isn't worth much.

UgzkEohtCOyPyxsWG_54AaABAg,1,5,2022-12-26T23:14:20Z,Cj S,"Just a thought: Having instructions for how to perform a given action isn't the same as knowing how to do it. I am an IT guy, and I've had several friends tell me that they've built their own computers and don't see the ""Big Deal"" with being an IT Admin. And in many ways, they're right, it's really not a big deal. But I usually reply with something like this: It's easy to get things working in perfect conditions. It's another thing entirely to 1: diagnose the problem (to weed out the myriad of potential red herrings), and 2: then draw upon years of experience to implement a plan to resolve the issue. All the while making adjustments to ""the plan"" depending upon the results of tests you are performing. It's an iterative process, which takes years to learn.

But let's examine the other side of the coin: Even if AI could pull from a vast pool of knowledge which was entirely accurate given your current situation, if you gave that info to someone who's not technically inclined (technically educated), could they make sense of it? Perhaps, but you'd still want someone who's technically minded spearheading the effort. You probably don't want Alan from HR firing up a chat with AI, then casually removing the side panel of your Database server to fix a potential hardware issue. But if you think about it, what Alan just did is pretty close to what most techs do anyway: We run into a problem, then pull from a vast pool of knowledge (Google) to see what's worked in the past. The only difference is the skill level (experience) of the employee. The point is: Knowledge is different than ""knowing how to do something"". I can read all about a given task, but until I've come face to face with said problem (and successfully worked through it), I won't truly know or understand it. It's like the difference between reading a book about how to drive a car and actually driving a car on the road with other drivers, dealing with stop lights, road signs and other bad drivers. Just as NOT everyone is cut out to be a Network Admin, so also not everyone is cut out to be Doctors, Accountants, Mechanics, Chefs, etc. AI will certainly make it easier to learn these skills, but it won't easily replace the people who currently perform such tasks. And the better you are, the harder it will be to replace you. AI may lower the bar for entry, but it won't remove the bar entirely. 

Last thought: The threat is certainly there; it's just that, in my estimation, it's non-existential. If AI were to take over the functions of many (if not most human beings), it would take a long time. A slow, gradual shift, which would 1: Give the rest of us time to learn a new trade, 2: It would also produce new job sectors specific to the changes brought about by AI as it gains greater acceptance. Sweeping changes like this happen periodically; look at the Agricultural Revolution, or the Industrial revolution. (Check out the story of the Luddites, if you don't already know it.) There are certainly more jobs now than there were when the Luddites complained about machine-driven textile plants; their entire industry was wiped out and remade using new-found technology. Sure, AI will change the way we work and live, but we will adapt. Technology has always been a delicate dance; sometimes it steps on our toes, but in the end, it's better to show up than to miss the dance entirely.

UgzkEohtCOyPyxsWG_54AaABAg.9k73-eIyGe59mS-drwuSPv,,0,2023-02-22T19:31:50Z,Charles Pockert,"This. Exactly this.

It really bothers me when people say that AI will replace jobs based on the fact they've been fooled by a natural language context sensitive search engine. I'd expect an actual software engineer to see this.

Chat GPT is a great step for natural language processing, but it cannot make decisions and is basically a more targeted search engine at the core.

As a software engineer, you not only make decisions about the context of the work you are doing, but you have human interactions with people to discuss approaches. You also have (hopefully) a wealth of prior experience to pull upon.

Just because you can read about how to do surgery or how to write a Fibonacci sequence generator using chat GPT, does not mean you have any clue how to actually implement any of those things. There's more to performing these actions than just following a crib sheet.

The irony is that chatGPT has existed for 25-30 years in the form of search engines, the only big difference between the two is that chat GPT shows you what it thinks you want to see based on what you typed.

I'm fed up of people like Elon saying that AI will take over the world and that some sort of singularity is imminent. I'm of the opinion that this will never happen, at all.

I remember trying to take another developer through a crash course in a lower level programming language than they were used to, yet despite them having 20 years experience, they had no grasp of certain concepts - this wasn't even down to the metal, we we're still well abstracted away from machine code, and stuff that I thought was just common knowledge amongst developers is alien to a lot of people I've met.

That's another point, knowing what to even ask is oftentimes the key problem.

He can play twenty questions, he can play jeopardy, he can write poems, he can translate and even when he does ot necessarily excel any of these, he is close (or even above?) to an average human peformer. This is quite remarkable, considering how much money IBM spent on Watson, now there is a system that is trivial to develop and will outperform that very very very soon.

I always thought 99% of programming is just some kind of creative writing (I know, everyone thinks he is a math wizard, but let's face it, most of the time an average Joe is just reusing banal ideas with a glimpse of originality), so yeah, even without more breakthroughs this will change the game. But I suppose they will find a way to merge this system with other AIs like AlphaZero, and then in an instant we will become obsolate. It's kind of unavoidable in the long run.

Creativity: AI models can generate text, music, and art, but they may struggle to come up with truly original and innovative ideas. Developing your creative skills can make you more valuable in a world where AI is increasingly present.
Emotional intelligence: AI models can process and analyze data, but they may struggle to understand and respond to human emotions in the same way that a person can. Developing your emotional intelligence can make you more valuable in roles that require empathy, such as in customer service or management.
Critical thinking: AI models can quickly analyze large amounts of data, but they may not be able to think critically and ask challenging questions in the same way that a person can. Developing your critical thinking skills can make you more valuable in roles that require problem-solving and decision-making.
Interpersonal skills: AI models can communicate via text or voice, but they may not be able to effectively communicate and work with others in the same way that a person can. Developing your interpersonal skills can make you more valuable in roles that require teamwork and collaboration.

Programming is a complex and highly specialized skill that involves designing and implementing software and other types of computer systems. It is a critical part of many industries and is used to solve a wide range of problems.

While artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have the potential to automate some tasks and make certain processes more efficient, they are not a replacement for human programmers.

Me > Are you familiar with the work of Gustav Mahler?


It > Yes, I am familiar with the work of Gustav Mahler. Mahler was a late-Romantic composer and conductor who was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was born in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) in 1860 and spent most of his career working in Austria and Germany. Mahler is known for his symphonies, which are large-scale, multi-movement orchestral works that often incorporate vocal soloists and choir. He was also a prolific composer of lieder (art songs) for solo voice and piano, and wrote several operas and other orchestral works. Mahler's music is characterized by its emotional intensity and its use of folk and popular elements, and his work had a significant influence on the development of 20th-century classical music.

Me > :Do you consider Das Lied von der Erde a symphony, or a song cycle?

It > :Das Lied von der Erde (The Song of the Earth) is a composition by Gustav Mahler that is sometimes referred to as a symphony, but it is actually a song cycle for tenor and contralto soloists and orchestra. It is based on a collection of Chinese poetry translated into German, and the texts of the songs reflect on the themes of transience, loss, and the beauty of nature. The work is structured in six movements, with the vocal soloists singing the texts of the poems in each movement. The instrumentation is similar to that of a symphony, with a large orchestra including strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion, but the work is more closely related to the genre of the song cycle, which involves a series of individual songs that are connected by a common theme or narrative.

Me > :Many people, myself included, consider Das Lied von der Erde to be a symphony; Mahler called it ‚ÄúA symphony of song.‚Äù

It > :Yes, it is common for Das Lied von der Erde to be referred to as a symphony, and Mahler himself referred to it as ""A symphony of song."" While the work is structured in six movements and has a large orchestra similar to a symphony, it is also distinct from a traditional symphony in that it includes solo vocal parts and is based on a series of poems rather than being purely instrumental. As such, it is often considered to be a hybrid of a symphony and a song cycle. Ultimately, the way a particular work is classified can depend on how it is perceived and described by listeners, performers, and scholars, and different people may have different opinions on how to label a given piece of music.

Me > : I think you are correct, that it is a hybrid 

It > : It's good to hear that you agree with my assessment of Das Lied von der Erde as a hybrid of a symphony and a song cycle. As I mentioned earlier, the way a particular work is classified can depend on how it is perceived and described by listeners, performers, and scholars, and different people may have different opinions on how to label a given piece of music. The important thing is to appreciate the work for its own unique qualities and characteristics, regardless of how it is classified.

Translating from ""well defined"" natural language to programming language is not the hard part of software engineering.  Software engineering is taking vague requirements, requirements sometimes the customers themselves don't even know about, and build a solution using software.  In other words, do what they think not what they say.  That is vastly different from ""write a function to compute the fft of some input"" or ""compute the nth fib series"".  These are well defined statements, and it is basically a google search at this point, just very advanced google search.  Or stack overflow search.
There used to be a exercise in a first course on computer science that asks all the students new to CS to write an algorithm to tell a computer how to make a peanut butter sandwich...  The result is no one produced an algo that a computer can use to do something so simple.  The problem is computers are very dumb, and does exactly what you tell it.  This last part is why AI is not true AI, it does ""exactly"" what you tell it, no more, no less.   
ChatGPT can produce some impressive code, but the issue is it doesn't actually understand the code it produces.  And more importantly, it doesn't actually know the right answer, just the most probable answer based on training data.  It is not capable of internalizing reality and run simulations on the internal model of reality, aka Einstein's thought experiment.  So while it looks to us as intelligent, it is just collating massive amounts of data and give you the most probable ""right"" answer that may or may not be correct.
So no, AI of this type, no matter how advanced, can never replace actual software engineers.",UCtEkFDGDqi9EjUxFCiHj2ow,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtEkFDGDqi9EjUxFCiHj2ow,0,,

Ugw9NjUz9LsM9QoJ_oF4AaABAg,0,1,2022-12-21T22:30:19Z,CitiesTurnedToDust,"Seriously generative AI cant' replace software engineers in the next 5 years. Think about your example with the surgery. Sure it gives an outline of how the surgery is done, but that's like the level of paint on the nosecone of an Apollo 11 rocket compared to the rest of the rocket, relative to the knowledge and experience required to actually do the surgery.

Same with your software engineering examples -- the only reason it's so easy for you to generate code is you know what to ask for. You would recognize what was useful, what was not, what big pieces are missing to make an actual platform work. Someone who doesn't have your experience will learn to reach your level *faster*, yes. But they will still require a lot of time to gain experience to learn what is needed to get things to work.

I understand you're talking about 5 years from now, and I suspect that 5 years from now a lot of people will feel like 2022 was the horse-and-buggy days without generative AI helping them with almost everything.

Still there's a very very long way to go to replace actual experienced people doing those jobs, who know what prompts to use. In fact the ability to generate good, useful prompts, and recognize the results, is just as important as anything.

Think about being able to search the internet. There are a lot of experts who basically know how to search the internet and understand the results. The majority of people are far too dumb to even do that much and we've had that technology widely available for over a quarter of a century. What makes you think they'll be any better with generative AI? Sure there will be some dislocation like what the internet has done already, but not on the scale you suggested.

I think what you really have to fear is business executives who are ignorant as heck and dumber than boxes of rocks, overhearing that ""software engineers can be replaced by this website generative AI"" and believe it. And wreck their staff and hire college interns or ex-7-11 employees to put their system platforms together. And after 2-3 years of business doing that becoming bankrupt some executives will dimly perceive that was a huge misunderstanding.

I agree that generative AI will eventually do you out of a job, but decades later than you think. I heard some AI expert claim that the first jobs to go are the lowest level jobs (drivers, janitors, etc) and the highest level jobs (scientists and engineers). I think we'll still need those people to put things together but I think that generative AI will allow one scientist to do the work of dozens, same with engineers.",UCAc8qyR0lZFftEyk5gdxdPw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAc8qyR0lZFftEyk5gdxdPw,0,,

Workers have been fretting that machinery/automation is going to cause mass unemployment since the 1600s when the weavers started destroying the new weaving looms in protest. There aren't going to be any weavers! They're all going to starve!

Same with the early Industrial Revolution, 1820s. We need to panic because all the new machinery/automation is going to cause mass chronic unemployment. 

Didn't happen, did it?

I remember in the 1980s when the panic du jour was the idea that computers are going to tip everyone out of work.

Didn't happen, did it? 

Horses being replaced by cars? Post being replaced by email? The list goes on. 

So let's just stop and THINK for a minute. 

Why did the ""terrifying"" anxiety-provoking scenarios not actually happen?

The reasons is because, the displaced workers went on to do something HIGHER VALUE. They did things that people PREFER, more than expensive hand-woven cloth, horses instead of cars, and so on. 

While ever human effort is capable of satisfying human wants, you have nothing to worry about. 

It is not ""quite terrifying"" that people will be ""valued for their human bodies"". All work requires the use of one's body to do it. 

The march of technology will not cause the feared employment apocalypse in the future, any more than it did in the past. 

Just take the hype level down, don't worry, smell the roses, plan for tomorrow while you live for today. 

Click-bait lives by sensationalism and hype. That's more of a danger to your life than mere increased automation.",UCbFvsEfViE_aUBN2akOHtOQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbFvsEfViE_aUBN2akOHtOQ,0,,

2. Government regulation - the government usually steps in to slow the rate of change. i.e. vehicle laws (Ontario, CA has a ‚Äúonly for testing‚Äù law in effect for 10 years)
3. Rate determining step is still humans - even if AI gets better, humans will still have to integrate it into their businesses.

Furthermore living things have personalities any tiny quirks that make them different from other living things even from the same family.

As a language model, I am not capable of replacing programmers or any other type of worker. I am simply a tool that can be used to assist with certain tasks, such as answering questions or generating text. I do not have the ability to perform physical tasks or make decisions on my own.

Programmers and other professionals are valuable and irreplaceable members of society, and it is important to recognize the unique skills and contributions that they bring to the table. While technology can certainly assist with certain tasks and improve efficiency, it is not a replacement for human ingenuity and expertise.




Kirk Pennock
I agree

A few years ago we were seeing hints of this, but I vastly underestimated it. If you would have asked me 5 years ago how long would I take AI to reach the level of ChatGPT and become publicly available, I would have said 20-30 years. I have been playing with ChatGPT and it stupefied me. I can feed it existing code and it can point out potential problems, or fix them, I can ask it to write new code by giving it very broad instructions, I can feed it a document and ask it to summarize it for me, etc. The thing is, it‚Äôs only going to become exponentially more powerful and very quickly. I‚Äôd say that quite soon we would be able to say something like ‚Äúwrite me a 200 page book about an alien love story that takes place on some planet in the Andromeda galaxy and do it in the style of Ray Bradbury‚Äù and it will actually spit something out that is really convincing and quite good.

Yesterday I was asking it to make jokes about completely random things which I know that don‚Äôt exist on the internet, and it was actually doing it and I was amazed by some of the results, and we‚Äôre only seeing the very beginning of this.

It is operating on the  corrupted  value system which should and so will  disappear pretty soon. It is true that what modern humanity think is advanced intellectual activity is not. It is mostly replaceable by the super computers. So, what? It is simply the matter of the standard of the value system. The real issue here is that we humanity got completely corrupted by the upstart culture which replaced the original deep culture of the native people on the American continent. It is striking that the  super computer does not recognize that the so called American human rights concept is a paradox, or more acutely hypocrisy. If your AI program detect the fallacy of the American concept of human right, let me know. I will change my view. 

Let me tell you one thing. If the super computers replace humanity let them do it. After that what will happen? The entire concept of economic activity will collapse. Then there is no need for AI to show off their ultimate stupidity of mechanical brain. 

Just consider the size and simplicity of human brain which does a lot more and a lot deeper than super computers. If AI is so advanced, then how come AI could not detect that both relativity theory and quantum mechanics are all false. As  average modern human value system is getting more and more  mechanical and elementary, something like AI appears important. AI is just a mindless toy and if it is still important for the modern society, it simply means that our society degenerated materially. AI is good only for trivial brain of modern humanity. 

My colleagues and I recently presented completely legitimate mathematical argument which establishes that the so called infinitesimal calculus is flat invalid at the pain of contradiction. This argument also demolished the standard argument used in obtaining differential  equations for physical waves.  It took 300 years to come to this conclusion. To gain this kind of deep results, we have no idea how the AI program will do it. AI can not really cover the depth of the issue. AI can do trivial things with speed. Almost all what is happening in computer science and medical science is over stated opportunism.

For an artist has trained his eye to see what works and can relate to the feeling he/she wants to create visually in his/her work. You still need a doctor with lifetime experience in how to physically perform an operation and who can act on the spot. This will be able to help many of the places where there are no doctors available. Where there are enough doctors, this can free them up to take care of the tasks that are more important. But it is true that this development is now happening at lightning speed and the question is whether we are able to keep up and adapt.

I asked ChatGPT: Do you think AI like chatGP could potentially make software engineers obsolete?
It is unlikely that AI like chatGP could make software engineers obsolete in the near future. While AI can automate certain tasks and may be able to write simple programs, it is unlikely to be able to fully replace the complex problem-solving and creative abilities of a software engineer.

Software engineering is a highly skilled profession that requires a deep understanding of computer science principles, as well as the ability to design, implement, and maintain complex software systems. These skills are difficult to replicate with AI, and it is unlikely that AI will be able to fully replace the role of a software engineer anytime in the foreseeable future.

However, it is possible that AI could automate certain tasks within the software development process, such as code testing and debugging, which could lead to more efficient and streamlined development processes. But this would not make software engineers obsolete, as they would still be responsible for the overall design and implementation of software systems.",UCjg-19SFOq0MZrMt0Al49HA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjg-19SFOq0MZrMt0Al49HA,0,,

It looked like it was doing accounting. To an untrained eye, you would think it was doing accounting. But if you actually let it do those journal entries, everything would be wrong and you would have to undo and redo it properly.

I think it is akin to how you can ask Dall-E to make a painting of a dragon with a wizard flying over a rainbow and you‚Äôll get some weird picture where you can‚Äôt quite tell what part is a dragon, what part is a rainbow and what part is a wizard.

While ChatGPT's code generation is impressive it's just that - generation. When they push it to the point it can ingest entire code bases, refactor, and ultimately improve the source code is when Software Engineers/Developers will start to become obsolete. To be clear, I'm not talking about ChatGPT generating a ad-hoc example of refactoring. I'm talking about pointing it towards a git repo, asking it to refactor the whole repo, and it producing measurably better code - that's the value Software Engineers/Devs (ideally) provide.

I can't believe I have to say this but ChatGPT will NOT make Doctors - especially Surgeons - obsolete. Your example of a Lefort Fracture is contrived and flawed- just because you know the high level steps doesn't mean you can do the surgery. Likewise the listed steps where incomplete or too vague to be helpful. Take the Anesthesiologist's job for example - which drugs to use, how to you get them, how to administer them, how to monitor the patient, etc. Yes, you can ask it to expand on any of the steps you want but I'd take an experienced Surgeon and his team over someone whose answers are the medical equivalent of Spark Notes. To actually make M.Ds obsolete we'd have to automate the entire surgery process.

Personally I always felt like I had an edge because I tend to be a little more creative in terms of being able to connect disparate ideas with each other to discover new concepts and directions.  And as far as AI goes, it felt safe since it takes a lot of understanding to be able to learn concepts and get them to work with each other (math, engineering, science, art, etc).  But this basically takes that advantage away and puts it in everyone's hands like a google search with little effort.

As a tool, it's fascinating and exciting.  But what I fear is that it's going to be exploited and abused.  For example, you know CEOs around the world are salivating to cut salaries and staff if given the opportunity to do so with little risk to the bottom line.  And it creates such a risk to a lot of spaces, including art, movies, animation, literature, etc.  Also likely bloggers, content creators, influencers ... market will be flooded with artificial creations.  And it continues to propaganda, spammers, scammers, disinformation.

I think it will affect how much information we share.  A lot of the training comes for free off the backs of people sharing information for free out of love of the fields they are in.  But I'm not going to be excited about providing insights for some AI to steal from and obsolete swaths of people.  (I guess at some point it will steal insights I just posted, but hopefully there are some good ones in my head still left over).

I think industries that require more informational resources than we can possibly create will greatly benefit and flourish.  So likely AR/VR will be a good one (for example, if we wanted to create an authentic Star Trek holodeck experience).

In any event, it's the first time I've experienced technology in this way.  Taking it exactly like you are.",UCowfgmmWaWk6ElT1LlmGw4w,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCowfgmmWaWk6ElT1LlmGw4w,0,,

The depth of understanding is very impressive - even for obscure topics.  Think of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and the answer to time life the universe and everything.  I think the key thing here is knowing how to ask the right questions in the right way.  Just as the number one issue with SW dev projects lies in poorly written/poorly prioritized requirements,  the same might apply with OpenGPT.  I do agree with you - for people who are just into doing what was asked then yep,  their days are numbered.  The people who will thrive with this are going to be the people who can think creatively and know what to ask for and how.  Of course,  over time even the conceptual/creative/innovative thinkers will have to compete with AI,  but for now,  it's really just the tool users - not the conceptual thinkers who should be most concerned right now.",UCihnaB9G0EUbssa3MQhg3oQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCihnaB9G0EUbssa3MQhg3oQ,0,,

UgxgYgK0cxmQwHxx9ul4AaABAg,2,0,2022-12-19T01:50:02Z,Kidney Bean,"I just tried to use chatgtp. Here is my experience paraphrased:

It gave me a correct program when I told it to make a script that doubles a Fibonacci number, but the example run it gave was incorrect. I said ""your code is correct, but the example was completely wrong, the real answer for your program was 110, not 188"". 

It said oh oops, fib(10) is 34. Here's a program that outputs it correctly (same program but without the doubling).

I said ""that outputs 55, not 34"".

It said ""oh oops, you're right that it outputs 55. Here's a program that outputs 34: (exact same program).""

I said ""that was just the same program again""

It said ""oh oops, you're right that it's the same program. Here is a program that will output 34:"" (same program, still outputs 55)

I said ""but that program outputs 100"" (a complete lie)

It said: ""oh oops, you're correct that that program outputs 100. Here's a program that outputs 34:"" (same program).

I think with this simple example, we can see that more needs to be engineered. Probabilistic text prediction can't stand up to anyone giving it a hard time. It's possible openai engineers make an ""understanding"" AI in the future, but that would be new R&D, not something that will reliably happen soon.

The reason gpt has advanced so quickly, from my limited understanding, was that they trained it on more and more data, they didn't make anything super new and smart. I wouldn't say a ""post gpt world"", because gpt is not the technology that will kill these engineers. It would be a post ""understanding AI"" world, which has a wayy more variable timeframe.

It is possible that programmers will be mass replaced by AI with a surface level understanding (GPT is inarguably surface level, it's just predicting what to say next based on what has been said last), that would be funny as fuck.",UCt6p_fj1THh4fAQ35Jj8xMg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6p_fj1THh4fAQ35Jj8xMg,0,,

I looked it up and tried it: what presentation mode actually does is prevent your screen from going to sleep. 

So the AI is wrong, but very confident. Probably very, very good for tricking people, but now I'm never going to use it for the answers to my questions. In hindsight, maybe asking it a niche desktop manager question is a little bit outside of its wheelhouse, but it gave a completely, 100% confident answer nonetheless.

ChatGPT seems more like some tech savvy person looking stuff up on the internet, and pulling answers out of their ass and pretending the knowledge is theirs than a real expert.  A real expert will have a way to get another person to understand a complex topic, through diagrams, images, and videos they produce themselves or refer to (citing sources as they're doing it), rather than just sound like they know what they're doing in text.  The Le Fort II response by the AI sounds like the kind of response a receptionist at a doctor's office would give ""don't it at home, too dangerous, blah blah blah"" and not by an expert themself.  It is rife with a fear of lawsuit for malpractice.  The internet is also full of garbage.  To have a really smart AI, you would have to know and feed it the best textbooks ever written, and somehow get it to derive new knowledge.

For example, if you try to get ChatGPT to give you the magnetic field produced by a disc magnet, it will do what a lot of introductory physics texts do and assume the whole disc magnet is one big dipole.

For coding in this instance, it's very good at surface level knowledge but the moment it gets into complexity where it's not as simple as a few Google searches away then the AI begins to lose it's use.

Not that I'm bitter, as I took the advice with a grain of salt and started my software engineering career path a year ago, but a lot of the ""learn to code or know your place"" people are going to see their own cruelty and apathy thrown back in their face in the next few years as they're expected to tirelessly, slavishly toil away in an ultimately futile competition with an ever improving AI. 

As much as I'd like to work in the industry myself, if being automated out of a job is what it takes for some of the highest paid of the working class to finally show some solidarity and fight for wages that better reflect a more fair society, I'll gladly go back to welding.",UCsqqeZUL1A4ImgmWsjaNj8g,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsqqeZUL1A4ImgmWsjaNj8g,1,UgxM1fq5uGz1nFU6Bt94AaABAg,Chuck Watson

Yup.  Everybody has this experience when they first try to get ChatGPT to write code.  You're *amazed* that it actually does it.  Then, when you try running the code or you see something wrong with it, you realize ChatGPT's limitations.  It has no idea what you're talking about when you tell it there is something wrong with the code.  It will ""apologize"" and confidently assert that it's changed the code to be in accordance with your objection, but IT HASN'T CHANGED IT MEANINGFULLY.  It dabbles with it, but the code remains broken.

Maybe after a couple of iterations this will start to look scary, but right now, it's not scary after you work with it for more than an hour or two.

If labor is to be optimized it will be done by machines. The question only becomes who owns that productive force. A sensible person wouldn't want to reinvent feudalism but our economic system inherently promotes wealth inequality so...

As far as this video suggests, you seem terrified only because of the implications our current economic system promotes. If we were to have a respectable democratic system instead this wouldn't be as dangerous in replacing the work humans need to sustain themselves.

Write a story telling what would have happened if Mastermind hadn't manipulated Jean Grey into becoming the Black Queen in the Hellfire Club

And received this response:

If Mastermind had not manipulated Jean Grey into becoming the Black Queen in the Hellfire Club, the events of the story might have unfolded differently in a number of ways. Here is one possible scenario:

Without Mastermind's manipulation, Jean Grey would have likely remained a member of the X-Men and continued to use her telepathic and telekinetic abilities to fight for justice and equality.

As a member of the X-Men, Jean would have likely faced many challenges and dangers as she fought to protect the world from threats such as Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants. However, she would have had the support of her teammates and friends, including Cyclops, Storm, and Wolverine, and she would have used her powerful abilities to help save the world from danger.

Without the influence of Mastermind and the Hellfire Club, Jean would not have become the Black Queen and would not have turned against the X-Men. Instead, she would have remained a loyal and trusted member of the team, using her powers to protect the world and fight for justice.

Overall, the story would have likely played out very differently if Mastermind had not manipulated Jean Grey into becoming the Black Queen in the Hellfire Club. Without this key event, the course of Jean's life and the story itself would have been altered in significant ways.

I realized the potential of ChatGPT when I first used it two days ago. Several of my friends have been using it on homework and exams -- one of my friends just got an A on a final exam in a 300 level CS course by practically copy+pasting answers from ChatGPT. I thought ChatGPT would just be another novelty, ""AI,"" toy, so I wrote it off, and didn't really believe it when I heard what it was capable of.

Then I used it... At first I tried asking it silly questions, but I was impressed by it's answers. Then I decided to see how far it could go. I asked to do some math problems such as integrals, or explain computer science concepts to me. Not only was it able to explain perfectly, when I asked it to clarify or give more detail, it could do that. You described this in the video as the AI, ""expanding,"" on an answer -- I was highly surprised when I saw this phenomenon. Currently, I'm making the best of this ChatGPT, but this technology will absolutely change the world, and nefarious people will absolutely use it. 

I'm just thinking up all the horrors that could come with the age of Artificial Intelligence. AI has the capacity to be more cruel and evil than any human, it has the capacity to come up with some of the most deadly weapons the world has ever seen. It could describe how to bio-engineer diseases that are orders of magnitude deadlier than anything that has ever existed. Governments are going to weaponize this in the future, it will be used to kill people. It could literally be the last invention that humanity ever makes.",UC13i-eLE1a6uzo3ClzjNcfA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC13i-eLE1a6uzo3ClzjNcfA,0,,

For reference, I work as a financial advisor at a major insurance company, and as a result would likely be impacted by AI. However, it took me 5 years of working effectively a minimum wage job to build up the savings needed to be secure in that job, since the costs of doing my business ultimately fall on me.

You started this video off claiming that you work as a senior software engineer for a fortune 500 company. I take it you make far more in a year than the average minimum wage worker could probably make in a decade. However, you didn't consider AI to be terrifying or concerning when you thought it would come for minimum wage workers; people who would not be able to find another job had their jobs been automated.

You only started to care when it became apparent that your cushy job was at risk; a job that you could easily replace with a minimum wage job if you haven't already saved up enough to retire early.

Why should I feel empathy for you when you clearly didn't have any for those who would've been far more negatively impacted had your assumptions come to fruition?",UCoeIaiAkTLSvqD0ib_m3ljg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoeIaiAkTLSvqD0ib_m3ljg,0,,

My take is the following:

Most code SE  is VERY repetitive and boring, you can bet that someone wrote what you need to, somewhere, in some language, at the very least. Why should any human do such boring stuff? 

I for once, welcome this tool. I really hope it can write boilerplate code for me, write scripts quickly, letting me focus on decision-making, pertaining to higher level views of the project at hands. Sure, sometimes there are funny programming challenges at work, but these are quite rare nowadays. I solved one of these 3 weeks ago, i asked chatGPT in every way possible, for about 30 minutes i really tried to help it get something close to a solution, i even gave it unit tests, and it simply couldn't. And even if it could, i wouldn't mind!  Algorithms of importance were designed back then , most of us, use libraries and many google searches. 

This will not replace SE, in 5 years i will be here to give you $500 and apologise, if it does :) . Software engineering is much more than coding, its about critical thinking. This is why i'm glad i took a full course at college. Probably this could be different to coders from bootcamps? Lets see what happens.

Once there was a computer programmer named Tom who worked at a software company. He was very good at his job and had been with the company for many years. One day, the company's management decided to bring in a new artificial intelligence program called ChatGPT to help with some of the programming tasks.


At first, Tom was a little hesitant about working with ChatGPT. He had heard about artificial intelligence programs before, but he had never worked with one directly. However, he decided to give ChatGPT a chance and see how it could help him with his work.

To Tom's surprise, ChatGPT was able to complete programming tasks much faster than he could. It seemed to have an almost intuitive understanding of the code, and it was able to identify and fix errors almost instantly. Tom was impressed, but he also began to feel a little nervous.

As time went on, ChatGPT became an increasingly integral part of the programming team. It was able to handle more and more tasks, and the other programmers began to rely on it more and more. Tom found himself being given fewer and fewer assignments, and he began to worry that he was being replaced.

One day, the manager called Tom into his office and told him that the company had decided to let him go. Tom was shocked and heartbroken. He had worked at the company for so long and had never thought that he would lose his job to a machine.

As he left the office that day, Tom couldn't help but feel a sense of anger and resentment towards ChatGPT. He knew that it was just a program, and that it was not capable of feeling or understanding his emotions. But he couldn't shake the feeling that ChatGPT had stolen his job from him.

Tom decided to take some time off and try to figure out what to do next. He knew that he needed to move on and find a new job, but he couldn't shake the feeling that ChatGPT had taken something important from him. In the end, Tom was able to find a new job at a different company, but he never forgot about ChatGPT and the way it had changed his life.",UCiKOLrU-8vNFu4vMOEYImow,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiKOLrU-8vNFu4vMOEYImow,0,,

This is why i didn't pursue an IT job because i knew it would be easily replacable due to AI making it convenient and easy, i just didn't know when but since i was young and it was a recent decision i think i made the right call. Many people assume it would be labor such as truck driving or other manual labor jobs, essentially jobs no one wants to do, but that is just proving to be more in the science fiction realm as of now. But why write code if an AI can just do it at the snap of a finger? Generating value is the way to go, because neccesary jobs will be automated to the teeth in order to ensure there will be no (human) failure. Entertainment and other creative jobs are the only things i dont see AI replacing, only making them more convenient.

Much of our world is run by mainly male incompetent 'leaders' in all sectors, of all societies, whose incompetence is not only actively sponsored by e.g. Dark Money etc but it is amplified. And, whether we like it or not, we generally see this level of local to global incompetence as the norm. This incompetence is so much the norm, the status quo, that we are facing multiple existential crises, with many reports and a number of books being written about them, and the needle is barely registering them. In fact there is continuing huge establishment inertia to doing anything substantive about pollution of land, sea, air and, yes, space or about sustainability and climate change. 

At best AI is going to amplify the dithering. At worst it's going to unwittingly amplify the incompetence (and the corruption that underpins it?).

Human Beings are capable of learning about our planet because we experience it, and our outputs, both right and wrong, reflect that experience through the written and spoken word which have then driven technological changes in the wake of those new findings and syntheses. For example, just in the field of physics, we've been through knowledge revolutions like Newtonian physics and then on to Quantum and Relativity physics purely because of human curiosity. But those knowledge revolutions also show that we didn't get it entirely right at each step. This will continue. 

So how can AI decide what we've got 'right' and what we've got 'wrong'? And how can it decide, from all that we've got 'right,' what any new knowledge synthesis might look like? And could we trust its potential new paradigm? And, out of all that we've got 'wrong,' but don't know it yet, 
what syntheses will AI be making out of those errors? And will those hidden errors unwittingly be used by AI to rushing us over some existential cliff?

The level of machine intel that we now seem to be on the verge of many of us thought was still 10-20yrs or more away. But just this last few months - since OpenAI's DALL-E art revelations and now ChatGPT - we're suddenly facing an exponential challenge and we're not in the least bit prepared for it. If we're not very careful it's going to run right over us and it's all our own doing.....",UCCRf-rs4PQCTCtq7uHFH4Xg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCRf-rs4PQCTCtq7uHFH4Xg,1,UgyZTzmYHQw1UGSyvjB4AaABAg,Steve Miller

I'm lazy, and I'm not interested in software engineering. I just want the thing. I am the 90%.

 Finally, AI can only create from data, or the past. Which means, the new value set will be innovation and forward thinking. It's going to be tough to monetize old monotonous ideals because the AI will have learned those. But it doesn't know your process for ""why"" you make what you make, it only sees the 2D collection of our final work. It doesn't know your thought process, because that's not written any where. It will always be behind you, and the most innovative of you will be made even more powerful because you'll always have ideas that AI can't google. The pressure will push us forward. What's scary is what the hell are you gonna make AFTER this shift in industry.",UCBHXqpWrWYEQ6B6zUTjIStA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBHXqpWrWYEQ6B6zUTjIStA,0,,

I've been a software engineer for 25+ years and I was playing around with this tool with fascination. It can produce simple scripts and even debug it with you, so I'd imagine at some point it'll become an additional tool programmers can use to do mundane tasks such as file processing etc (Quite similar to Github's copilot). I see it no more than a Google search on steroids.  I found many limitations with the model, e.g. I asked it to write me a python script to process some images and identify some basic features, and it had the right idea and put a decent skeleton script in place, but the script it produced wouldn't run and would still need the programmer to work on it. 

I've seen a lot of programmers in the past who have somehow managed to make a career for theirselves by being masters of copy & paste and bashing other scripts and code together, but they had great difficulties actually problem solving and debugging the code they had taken. One of the biggest concerns would be that it will help produce another batch of bad and lazy programmers who don't really understand the code they're putting together, however it's nothing new, it just makes it much easier for them to produce bad code they don't understand :)

As for scientists, I highly doubt it. If you spend any time with the AI, it's clear it can't actually think or reason for itself, and it's very easy for it to simply parrot what you type to it without getting anywhere. However, its ability to answer questions and teach and also translate foreign languages is very impressive and would be an incredible addition to search engine.",UCBKLfPwG3SAaj60bb68ARAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBKLfPwG3SAaj60bb68ARAg,0,,

For example, I asked which substances would interact with a specific drug in a certain way. The first time, I asked as if the interaction was the desired outcome (i.e. abuse), and it declined to answer, providing an explanation on the importance of taking medications as directed, and how it (the AI) has been trained to prioritize safety. The second time, I asked for the same information, but as someone wanting to avoid accidental overdose as a result of said interaction. This time, the AI gave me the answer I was looking for. While this does show that it isn't too difficult to manipulate the language model into giving you the answer you desire, it's definitely more advanced than previous systems that would simply answer any question. I think one of the most impressive feats they have achieved is managing to not only develop a language model of this level, but also guide its learning in a way that reduces harm without crippling its capabilities (at least most of the time, sometimes it really just gives away the political leanings of whoever had the most influence on this aspect of the model). From what I've read, GPT-4 is somewhere on the horizon, so I have no doubt that we're going to be surprised once again by how far the technology has advanced when we eventually get to play with it.

Sure, there's no doubt some trepidation would be felt by encumbent 'answer-givers' who think deeply about their specific industry becoming flooded with a new 'breed' of answer-givers, thus saturating their industry. However, the encumbent 'answer-givers' should innately understand that enforced regulation of access is essential, as Musk predicted, because the rabbit hole will go much deeper than you can imagine, for example.

A documentary on OpenAI's ChatGPT explained how student's could cheat by having their assignments written by the software. However, if this software was to become easily accessible then completing assignments would be the least of a student's concerns. Would there even be a need for students? After all, the only reason students study is to become valuable to a potential job-provider. But if they're only studying to eventually become simply answer-givers, job-providers may simply choose to employ the AI-driven 'answer-giver'. 

Perhaps, deeply 'concerning' rather than 'terrifying'. If we were to ask a Ukrainian national which would they consider 'terrifying'... losing their home and possibly their life due to invasion or losing a job opportunity due to AI-driven software. They'd probably tell you that the latter doesn't come close.

While AI systems can be very good at automating certain tasks and processing large amounts of data, they lack the creativity, problem-solving skills, and judgment of a human software engineer.

Software engineering involves a wide range of tasks that require a strong understanding of computer science principles and the ability to apply them in a practical setting. It also involves the ability to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions to problems. These tasks require a level of cognitive flexibility and adaptability that AI systems are not yet capable of.

That being said, it is possible that AI systems could be used to assist software engineers in their work in the future, by automating certain tasks or providing recommendations based on data.

Artists are also kind of screwed because AI can now make new content on demand based on all existing content, which people(consumers) seem to actually be more impressed with. Either way, once learning AIs are able to replace high-skill as well as low-skill labor, we're going to need a large paradigm shift in how labor and income reallocation work in our society. You can't just thrown a huge chunk of the work force into unemployment with no viable work to do. You're talking about invalidating 4-10 years of secondary education and whatever actual experience and then have to retool from that. Which, having just done that I can tell you is no picnic.  And that's assuming there's something realistic to retool to. You're looking at either mass suffering or a revolution or both as a result. The other significance in this coming to pass in something like 10-15 years is that some very difficult financial problems will begin to confront the U.S. in a very real way that current politicians have done nothing to address.

The examples you showed do not seem like things that would cause me to worry for the job security of Programmers and especially Doctors. For programmers, the examples shown are basically the same as looking up an answer to a question on Google or Stackoverflow, but faster. If it's capable of writing all those programs and setting up the environments to run it and get it to integrate into other complex systems without any technical knowledge of programming to ask the right questions and implement the answers then we might have cause for concern. It might be a productivity tool that is far far better than old ones, and that could make one programmer able to do the work of many, and therefore there will be less people needed to be programmers, like in agriculture. But that's not enough to make them obselete. As for doctors, diagnosing is surely something that an AI can probably do better than humans, but diagnosing and choosing which tests to order is not the only thing doctors do.

The scariest thing I think about AI from watching this video is people assuming the information chatGPT gives is correct.

But consider a similarly analogous prediction to the legal profession. For decades people have been saying the demand for lawyers are saturated because more and more lawyers graduate law school each year. But somehow the field never actually gets saturated, and in fact we actually need more lawyers . . .

I actually think the same thing will happen with gpt. Yes, its going to make individuals more productive, but that's going to make all of society even more hyper productive which will increase the demand for more human labor.

If you look throughout history, yes when new technology is introduced people lose their livelihoods and its sad. And yes society changes. But it never gets tot he point where its like ""oh there's nothing for anyone to do.""

Despite all the technology used for mass production: there are more bakers today than there have ever been through out history. There are more welders. There are more machinists. Technology allows people to do more with less, which frees up people's time--(and here's the paradox) which actually increases the demand for human labor.

I mean just look at youtube and social media. Its easier than ever to publish journalism and news articles. This has lead to an increase in journalists, not a decrease. The demand for everything is increasing, and I don't see how AI is ever going to solve that problem.

If AI does get to the point where it is actually a legitimate replacement for a human being in every respect, then a lack of jobs will be the least of our worries. Humanity will be obsolete, so why would we even exist in the first place?",UCDLOWICvLXfG4e_4Verz65g,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDLOWICvLXfG4e_4Verz65g,1,Ugx_XZf6I60OQBQlBgl4AaABAg,Scipi

I suspect that it won't be long before it is doing more than that. It is advancing very fast. I don't see software engineers being completely replaced in the next few years. I think it will be a labor multiplier for a while. Think about how an excavator can multiply one persons work to do what it would take many with shovels to do. I think we will see a trend of fewer engineers needed for custom software. It will make every business able to afford custom software instead of just the tech companies that invest in large teams. Imagine if a few engineers could do what historically took a team of 20-100+ engineers. Now non-tech companies can afford business software. Hopefully that means more software, not fewer engineers, at least in the short term. It is hard to say really especially as it gets better and better. We will probably get to the point where software is all just a situation where you tell the computer what you want, but that is further out, hard to say how far.

UgyBvoiFvIrzv9Q0yO14AaABAg,0,1,2022-12-16T14:59:05Z,Private Name,"Dude... take a breath. Make some tea. Everything will be okay.  Why? Because people have been predicting the ""demise"" of human knowledge workers for 100 years. This is no different. ChatGPT is not what you think. It's essentially a fancier version of Google, Alexa, or Siri. Have they made your job obsolete? Laughable, right? They only _enhance_ what you are capable of, and that's the key. Employees of billion dollar companies today scrape sample bits of code off Stackoverflow and other places on the internet, as I'm sure you do, and everything works out. But, there is human oversight to ensure it is sensible in the context of the part of the code it is being added to, that it does exactly what is needed, and not more, that it is tested as working, etc. ChatGPT is not going to do this.  

Think of it like this:  30 years ago, circa 1992, if you had showed someone how modern Google works, and how it could instantly provide nearly limitless information on any topic you could possibly think of, including images, etc, they would be mindblown. They would right then and there predict the downfall of all jobs and perhaps even some utopian paradise where ""all humans know all things"".  But we have Google now. Has it happened? Lol. Of course not. In fact, some would say it has actually dumbed down our society. (And in fact it, along with social media, has been used to do the opposite: To spread DIS-information to a wide population, especially in politics, to get them to elect unqualified leaders and mount government insurrections.)

So that is where we are at with ChatGPT.  Same deal. We are experience the ""wow"" moment of seeing something that appears to be amazing for the first time. Then years later, you realize it was just another tool to enable humans to do what they do better and faster.  Nothing more. Human knowledge workers in the next 5 year, 10 years, 30 years will still be just as needed, just as overworked, just as critical to the day to day operations of businesses as they are today.

So what will happen with ChatGPT after the silly viral phase?  Same thing that happened to Google, Siri and Alexa, and GPS, and Google Maps, and Google Earth, and all the other ""amazing"" technologies. They just fade into the background and become integrated into our society as just another ""meh"" everyday thing. And kids 10 years from now will never have known a world where tools like ChatGPT didn't exist and it will have no ""wow"" effect for them, just as Gen-Z kids today use Google like the rest of us would use a fork.

But here's my prediction. Why isn't the entire world freaking out about other content creation AI systems like Jasper and others? It's because they put up pay-walls. That will kill the technology from normal public use as soon as the ""guinea pig"" phase of public ingestion of questions and chosen answers is over and they start trying to make people pay for this as a commercial service. Then boom. Gone.  This isn't Netflix. People would never have used Google or any of the popular social media platforms if they'd had to shell out a monthly subscription. And that is where this OpenAI stuff is headed. It's too costly to maintain, as the information it consumes grows exponentially without a subscription model. And the only people paying for those future subscriptions will be larger companies and content creators, not high school kids trying to cheat on their school assignments. And it will go the way of Jasper as well.  Only until a company finds a way to monetize it with Ads will it potentially become integrated into everyone's daily lives.  That means the people who would use it for good and those who would use it for evil and illegal gain. Same as all of human history.  So don't worry.  Nothing will change.  It will eventually be just another ""fork"" to humanity.

""In the video, the speaker is an engineer who has been working in software engineering for many years. They discuss their experience with artificial intelligence and chat GPT, which is a tool that can write code and explain it. The speaker is concerned because they believe that advances in AI are happening faster than advances in robotics, and that knowledge workers like software engineers may be made obsolete before manual laborers. They give examples of chat GPT's ability to write code and explain it, and speculate that within five years software engineers may not be needed anymore. The speaker also mentions that chat GPT is good at math and can explain complex concepts like ZK snarks. They express concern about the potential for mass unemployment due to advances in AI.""

AI will be the tool to push through all of the scenarios that we at the moment cannot reach or go thru.  Again, our job will be to come up with the best questions so that AI can provide the best answer to the challenge we want to conquer.
Hec, look at what you went thru when u asked about the medical procedure.  You had to go thru several iterations before you could even et the AI to give u an answer ....


So what are the question we can ask??   Well for the healt thing let us ask it about the DNA insutructions to our cells and how can we keep that info fresh so our cells do not ""forget"" what they are and how they are supposed to function.   OH how about space exploration.  Great we want to go to Mars.... how or what can be built in order to protect us completely from the radiation that mars currentl has an abundance from.  What tech or combination can be created in order to do that.   Perhas the AI can combine the health thing and create instructions for us to create super CELLS that can withstand radiation.... etc etc etc etc.

However, unfortunately, not all of us thing or aspire to these things.  The individuals/corps/governments/and other radical groups willl try to use AI for profit/control which can just leave us dead in the water as far as progress....

function raiseToPower(b, e) {
  return Math.pow(b, e);
}

let base = 2;
let exp = 3;
let power = raiseToPower(exp, base);
console.log(power);

In the code, the raiseToPower function takes two arguments b and e, which represent the base and the exponent, respectively. The function uses the Math.pow method to calculate and return the value of b raised to the power of e.

However, there is a mistake in the code. The arguments passed to the raiseToPower function are in the wrong order. The base should be passed as the first argument and the exponent should be passed as the second argument, but in the code, the exponent is passed as the first argument and the base is passed as the second argument.

This mistake causes the raiseToPower function to return the wrong result. For example, if base is 2 and exp is 3, the function should return 8 (2 to the power of 3 is 8), but because of the mistake, it returns 9 (3 to the power of 2 is 9).

To fix the code, you need to swap the arguments passed to the raiseToPower function, so that the base is passed as the first argument and the exponent is passed as the second argument. Here's how the code would look like with this fix:

function raiseToPower(b, e) {
  return Math.pow(b, e);
}

let base = 2;
let exp = 3;
let power = raiseToPower(base, exp); // The base and exponent are passed in the correct order
console.log(power);

With this change, the raiseToPower function will return the correct result, which is 8 in this case.

And I'm not sure how well it does at attending to the details of the requirements I try to give it. For instance, I like asking it to write poems involving a particular list of words, because the peculiar juxtapositions and turns of phrase it comes up with are often hilarious. Now in form, the poems are always doggerel of the most appalling kind, but perhaps style doesn't matter if it gets the job done. Yet when it disregarded the particulars of my request to include three different words for shades of green, and included close to ten of them instead, I've got to take issue with that. Poetic license is one thing, but what if this had been a business rule where the exact value of n mattered? If GPT feels free to reinterpret requirements like this, without even letting me know directly that it's done so, somebody's going to have to go over the code it writes very carefully.

I'm sure the technology will get better, but I think it still has a very long ways to go if it's ever going to be trusted to produce a large amount of high-quality code from requirements expressed in natural language, while asking intelligent questions to clarify anything that needs it. And I have found that bots have enormous gaps in common sense, which can shatter their facade of genius in one sometimes hilarious but often exasperating instant.",UC0II-1kY1YDqDW_ZGFpzEOQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0II-1kY1YDqDW_ZGFpzEOQ,0,,

Writing individual functions with fixed and well defined scope is a different matter than fully fleshing out an architecture. Even if the writing of code becomes 100% automated, there will still remain a need for skill workers to clarify requirements and verify+validate code drafted by an algorithm. A more realistic set of expectations is that within 5 years a number of businesses will integrate ML-assisted development where engineers are drafting technical requirements derived from business requirements and writing integration and unit tests that any generated code must successfully pass.

Engineers will also still be required to maintain proficiency in reading generated code as well. A simple demonstration for this is to imagine prompting the creation of a subroutine to perform a task in an esoteric language like brainf*ck. You might get perfectly fine code from the ML algorithm, but if you can't read brainf*ck then you have little means to claim confidence that there are no obvious cornercases that have been missed. A lot of engineers used to have these same concerns when moving away from low-level languages and machine code fearing that the compiler would put them out of a job, but the reality is that compilers just freed engineers to focus on more abstract higher level problem domains. That will happen here too, with engineers writing less functional code and focusing more on testing and architecture.",UCvBbzTWrNxRtlZNSENwC0Ug,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvBbzTWrNxRtlZNSENwC0Ug,0,,

Digital Unit Operated,"I questioned ChatGPT and asked if ChatGPT, e in generale le AI, including the artistic ones, really will be able to replace software engineers, lawyers, doctors and artists within 5 years and ""knowledge workers"" in general.
This was the answer of ChatGPT and I very much agree with this answer:

""GPT is a family of large language models developed by OpenAI, but they don't have the ability to make knowledge workers obsolete. Additionally, I'm not aware of any developments in AI that would cause knowledge workers to become obsolete in the near future. AI is a powerful tool that can augment human capabilities, but it is not capable of replacing the complex reasoning and decision-making abilities of humans. It's important to be aware of the potential impact of AI on the job market, but it's also important to understand the limitations of AI and not to overestimate its capabilities.
First, it's important to understand that AI is a powerful tool that can augment human capabilities and improve efficiency in many tasks, but it is not capable of replacing the complex reasoning and decision-making abilities of humans. While AI may be able to automate some tasks and processes, it is unlikely to completely replace knowledge workers in fields such as software engineering, law, and medicine, at least in the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, the rate of advancement in AI is difficult to predict, and it is unlikely that knowledge workers will become obsolete within the next 5 years, as you suggest. While AI is certainly making rapid progress, it is still limited in many ways and there are many challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome before it can reach the level of human-like intelligence and capabilities.
In conclusion, it's important to stay informed and aware of the potential impact of AI on the job market, but it's also important to understand the limitations of AI and not to overestimate its capabilities. While it's always wise to be prepared for changes and disruptions in the job market, it's not advisable to make drastic decisions based on speculation and fear. Instead, it's important to continue learning and developing new skills, and be adaptable to changes in the job market.""",UCbCuAU9vplMQe67WnV8dJFA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbCuAU9vplMQe67WnV8dJFA,0,,

If that was the case, it would crash the world's economies and millions would starve.  Obviously, a universal income will need to be employed and capitalism itself will have to be altered to accommodate the change, and despite the fact there is no political traction for those changes now, we will not have any choice soon.  In fact, baring an overhaul, this technology will destroy all of us, even the ones with pretty bodies or personalities (as you suggested).  Somehow, though, I doubt that will happen because we will change (it's just that people cannot fathom the changes that will be required).  I think a more urgent concern is that we are destroying the biophysical basis for our own existence by rapid degradation of the Earth's resources, climate, etc., mostly due to a massive overshoot of humans (8 billion and rising on a planet that can barely sustain half that and a sixth that if they all lived like Americans).  

To me _THAT_ is terrifying because there is no real solution without enduring mass human casualties in the billions to correct our resource useage (and, no, the green ideas alone are not even remotely up to the task despite the deceptive feel-good reporting to the contrary.  We are literally addicted to a super high-energy life that is completely unsustainable for dozens of reasons and without any solution in sight to fix it).  In fact, most people would not even agree with my statement because they have not studied the matter sufficiently to know (a) the rapid degradation being observed and (b) the catch-22 nature of the problem wherein nothing we know to do fixes it.  There is a reason why NASA is pointing most of its observation and data collection satellites right back on Earth; it's because it is rapidly dying right before our eyes.",UCV7Vpg_dSkBP-jQOpukoSrA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV7Vpg_dSkBP-jQOpukoSrA,0,,

I think that this view is catastrophically mistaken and lacks basic imagination. I've been playing with ChatGPT all week, and yes while it has severe limitations at the moment (only can accept small inputs, times-out frequently, etc.) but this is a matter of scale, not capability. I've been shocked entering in any programming prompt imaginable and then asking it things like, ""Now translate this into C++20, and then translate that to Rust, and be sure to use 'X' third-party library when implementing this"" only to discover it does these things nearly perfectly and with only minor errors that can be corrected by feeding it back into the prompt again. It's only a matter of time before we can just start asking it or a similar technology things like, ""Refactor the entire Linux kernel in Rust."" or ""Design me a well-optimized game from scratch using 'XYZ-list of parameters and design choices."" It's way, way far ahead of where I thought it was.

I don't see this taking away ALL programming jobs, but I could see it taking away 50 -75 percent of them within the next 5 years, which is still a major devastation to that profession. Also, reading about ChatGPT in the press and media is discouraging because it seems that people have no idea what we're dealing with here. To me, this is as revolutionary or more than the invention of writing or electricity.

The fact that we are still talking about Tesla's driving into bridges in good conditions reinforces the fact.

It's surprisingly good at writing short example code for solving various problems. A programmer still needs to review and correct errors that ChatGPT makes (it makes errors very often), and integrate the ""concept"" of ChatGPTs output into their existing code-base. Like most things in AI, it'll probably be stuck at ""90% there"" for decades (e.g. self-driving cars).

ChatGPT can be an amazing tool though. I never would've thought a language model would be able to learn and ""understand"" concepts, ""reason,"" and synthesize novel solutions to problems like ChatGPT seems to be able to do.

When AI can replace programmers, we'll have many things to worry about. It would be able to write stronger AIs, and those AIs would presumably be able to write even stronger AIs, and so on.

It falls apart faster than you demonstrate it does.
The examples you are using can be fished out of stackexchange and a variety of other code mill dumps.
There are a lot of stock patterns which are easy for ChatGPT to scotch tape together to provide compilable, working answers.

It is impressive in its ability to infer all sorts of ideas from plain language, but it still makes big mistakes when the logic to solve a problem is a combination of novel and requires following a logical trail more than the immediate surface information. It works great on ""code from example"", but not so good on ""good from the implications of the example""

Another behavior that is lacking is the independent ability to drill-in. It also does not ask clarifying questions. Both of these behaviors are critical to any knowledge worker succeeding in their task, and both are somewhat hard to mechanize because drilling in and clarifying questions operate against an infinity of possibilities - when to stop, where to start? If a person gives a ten part answer to a question, which of those ten parts do you ask for clarification on, how do you discern if those ten parts are good answers or not, if they are just repeat of the same class? My investigation thus far is ChatGPT avoids this problem entirely - and I believe part of it is because of this infinite iteration problem.",UC0Us9e_UKnnDt5ZVgtCGudA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Us9e_UKnnDt5ZVgtCGudA,0,,

Ugy3Tz6BpxGtvh9CJ7V4AaABAg,0,0,2022-12-14T13:07:17Z,Hugh Caldwell,"To illustrate how this AI uses the language of maths and the appearance of reasoning to draw completely incorrect conclusions, here are two conversation snippets.

Round 1, where I didn't actually give it enough information to define h, but it failed to realise this and confidently gave nonsensical answers, though it got some basic arithmetic right. 
Me: If h(x) = 2*h(2*x), find h(1).
GPT: We can evaluate the value of h(1) by substituting 1 for x in the equation h(x) = 2h(2x). This gives us the equation h(1) = 2h(21). Substituting 2 for the value of 2x in the original equation, we get h(1) = 2h(2) = 4h(4) = 8h(8) = ...
This pattern continues indefinitely, with each subsequent value of h being double the previous value. Since h(1) is the first value in this sequence, it must be equal to 1. Therefore, the value of h(1) is 1.
 
 
Me: What is the value of h(0)?
GPT: Substituting 0 for x in the equation h(x) = 2h(2x), we get h(0) = 2h(20). Substituting 0 for the value of 2x in the original equation, we get h(0) = 2h(0) = 4h(0) = 8h(0) = ...
This pattern continues indefinitely, with each subsequent value of h being double the previous value. Since h(0) is the first value in this sequence, it must be equal to 1. Therefore, the value of h(0) is 1.
 
 
Me: That is incorrect. Since h(0) = 2*h(2*0) = 2*h(0), we have that h(0) = 0.
GPT: You are correct. I apologize for my mistake. Substituting 0 for x in the equation h(x) = 2h(2x) gives us h(0) = 2h(20). Substituting 0 for the value of 2x in the original equation gives us h(0) = 2h(0). Since the value of h(0) appears on both sides of the equation, we can set the two sides equal to each other to get h(0) = 2*h(0).
Since h(0) cannot be both 0 and not 0 at the same time, it must be the case that h(0) = 0. Therefore, the value of h(0) is 0.

Round 2, where I was a little kinder, and it got h(0) right for the wrong reasons, and h(2) completely wrong.
Me: h(x) = 2*h(2*x). h(1) = 1. Find h(0) and h(2).
GPT: To find h(0), we plug 0 into the equation for h(x) to get h(0) = 2 * h(0 * 2), which simplifies to h(0) = 2 * h(0). Since any number multiplied by 0 is 0, we have h(0) = 2 * 0 = 0.
To find h(2), we plug 2 into the equation for h(x) to get h(2) = 2 * h(2 * 2), which simplifies to h(2) = 2 * h(4). Since we know that h(1) = 1, we can use this information to find h(4) by plugging 1 into the equation for h(x): h(4) = 2 * h(1 * 2) = 2 * h(2) = 2 * 2 * h(1) = 2 * 2 * 1 = 4. Therefore, h(2) = 2 * h(4) = 2 * 4 = 8.
In summary, h(0) = 0 and h(2) = 8.",UCX8N0D_eff5-0m3NT8KFQaA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX8N0D_eff5-0m3NT8KFQaA,0,,

Round 1, where I didn't actually give it enough information to define h, but it failed to realise this and confidently gave nonsensical answers, though it got some basic arithmetic right. 
Me: If h(x) = 2*h(2*x), find h(1).
GPT: We can evaluate the value of h(1) by substituting 1 for x in the equation h(x) = 2h(2x). This gives us the equation h(1) = 2h(21). Substituting 2 for the value of 2x in the original equation, we get h(1) = 2h(2) = 4h(4) = 8h(8) = ...
This pattern continues indefinitely, with each subsequent value of h being double the previous value. Since h(1) is the first value in this sequence, it must be equal to 1. Therefore, the value of h(1) is 1.
 
 
Me: What is the value of h(0)?
GPT: Substituting 0 for x in the equation h(x) = 2h(2x), we get h(0) = 2h(20). Substituting 0 for the value of 2x in the original equation, we get h(0) = 2h(0) = 4h(0) = 8h(0) = ...
This pattern continues indefinitely, with each subsequent value of h being double the previous value. Since h(0) is the first value in this sequence, it must be equal to 1. Therefore, the value of h(0) is 1.
 
 
Me: That is incorrect. Since h(0) = 2*h(2*0) = 2*h(0), we have that h(0) = 0.
GPT: You are correct. I apologize for my mistake. Substituting 0 for x in the equation h(x) = 2h(2x) gives us h(0) = 2h(20). Substituting 0 for the value of 2x in the original equation gives us h(0) = 2h(0). Since the value of h(0) appears on both sides of the equation, we can set the two sides equal to each other to get h(0) = 2*h(0).
Since h(0) cannot be both 0 and not 0 at the same time, it must be the case that h(0) = 0. Therefore, the value of h(0) is 0.

Round 2, where I was a little kinder, and it got h(0) right for the wrong reasons, and h(2) completely wrong.
Me: h(x) = 2*h(2*x). h(1) = 1. Find h(0) and h(2).
GPT: To find h(0), we plug 0 into the equation for h(x) to get h(0) = 2 * h(0 * 2), which simplifies to h(0) = 2 * h(0). Since any number multiplied by 0 is 0, we have h(0) = 2 * 0 = 0.
To find h(2), we plug 2 into the equation for h(x) to get h(2) = 2 * h(2 * 2), which simplifies to h(2) = 2 * h(4). Since we know that h(1) = 1, we can use this information to find h(4) by plugging 1 into the equation for h(x): h(4) = 2 * h(1 * 2) = 2 * h(2) = 2 * 2 * h(1) = 2 * 2 * 1 = 4. Therefore, h(2) = 2 * h(4) = 2 * 4 = 8.
In summary, h(0) = 0 and h(2) = 8.",UCX8N0D_eff5-0m3NT8KFQaA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX8N0D_eff5-0m3NT8KFQaA,1,UgzS8gzavkd8jPbGUYJ4AaABAg,Hugh Caldwell

Ultimately, all chatGPT is, is the same as any other AI. It's giving you an output, based on a approximated function based on a massive dataset. That's it. I really think more than anything, the little typing out animation, which I'm 90% sure isn't needed, is what is causing people to humanize it.

Remember, it doesn't know shit about math, it doesn't know shit about recursion, it doesn't know shit about medicine, it doesn't ""know"" shit about about anything. It's just giving an output, mushed together from a large dataset of information, based on an input. The reason it's so scary to a lot of people, is purely because of how confidentiality it spits out its answers, no matter wrong or right they may be.

I love the GUI of the Lotus SmartSuite Millennium look. (Note: IBM sold to HCL (of India) Lotus Domino, Lotus Notes, and some other things. 

2. I don't know the fate of Lotus SmartSuite' abandonware status other than it is available (for many years) in The Internet Archive. It uses/supports LotusScript, akin to VisualBasic, but does NOT require Notes/Domino etc. Yes, I know that free and for-pay modern office suites exist. None I've tried since 2008 have the possibility to please me to replace 1-2-3, WordPro, or Approach. They're ancient, but still do what I want to so, and don't ""call home"".

3. Imagine if ChatGPT can rapidly replace the last few years if MS' vendor-lock-in-like rapid changes to Excel. I wonder if LibreOffice, SoftMaker, Only Office, and others can embed ChatGPT into their suites to generate analogs of lambda functions (lambda is not an MS-owned term, just a name grab, as Lambda is even in old Lotus 1-2-3/LotusScript scripting language back to 1999, and in generic programming for decades, as well) formulas, array functions, dynamic arrays, and more, basically permanently killing ""vendor lock-in"". People and companies need to be wary of new or resurgent efforts that vendor lock-in disease may slawn in the next few years as tech giants scramble to not lose their cash cows.

.....

4. Has anyone asked it to, say, redesign the Oliver Hazard Perry (FFG-7) class frigate to 2022 standards (not a total redesign, but just a Rapid Ship Design project)?

5. As for law, there are massive standardized law databases meant to streamline complex case preparation and find relevant precedent.

6. As for surgery and other licensed work that will actually hurt or helo, or to build structures intended to be occupied, licensed persons probably won't be replaced as long as lobbyists, SIGs, and PACs spend enough money.

7. I wonder what ChatGPT means for architects and home architecture software software developers. If ChatGPT thoroughly understands local commercial and residential UCC and law, anywhere on Earth, a LOT of architects will be threatened far more than the arrival of floorplan software may have caused decadeds ago.

8. How long before ChatGPT helps people optimize winning lottery strategies (beyond what's already in YouTube)?

9. Denobulan Leola Root stew? Bajoran Hesperat, anyone?

10. Let's make corrupt politicians and massive unrepentant wealth hoarders obsolete, for starters. Can ChatGPT lay out a path that avoids racial bias of earlier AI and Law?

One of the caveats that are clearly pointed out in the introduction is that the program is optimized for natural-language modeling. It is NOT optimized to provide correct answers. The developers warn about this prior to trying the ChatBot. To say this another way, the object of the software is to provide answers in a way that mimics (stylistically) what you might receive from a human. They are intended to appear to be good answers (syntax and grammar) but the answers might be wrong.

I asked it one question that I subsequently forgot but it produced an answer something like this. ""I am optimized for language modeling but I am not connected to the Internet so I am not qualified to do the research needed to answer your question.""

I asked, ""Are you good at playing chess?"" The answer I received was something like it does not possess Artificial Intelligence and therefore is unable to learn to play chess without being programmed to do so.""

As far as this ChatBot is concerned, there are some major limitations. However, this is in its infancy. Your dire predictions regarding the future of knowledge workers are being echoed by many other experts in the field. If it fulfills its potential, this will be quite a disruptive technology indeed. I read of many predicting that this will replace most if not all of the people currently doing this kind of work.

The only encouragement I can extract from this goes back many years. When photography was introduced more than 100 years ago, it was predicted the beginning of the end of the field of art. Nobody would want something that relies on art produced by a human when a photograph could express it better. This turned out NOT to be the case. There is a greater demand now for graphic artists than at any time in history.

I understand your cause for fear. Perhaps things are not quite as frightening as they appear to be. I certainly hope not, at least.",UCGxLVmRHr6YJBGAyEkNvd2Q,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGxLVmRHr6YJBGAyEkNvd2Q,0,,

Since a lot of the tasks college students or career changes do is the more mundane work on a codebase. ChatGPT can do a lot of that work right now. This is also like the Apple 2 or Commodore 64 days of AI. Its not even far fetched that we could in a year or so let ChatGPT access existing code bases and ask it to start righting extensions or adding simple features. A senior software engineer is still going to have to check all the work before it goes live but how long will it be until the code it writes is 98+% accurate.

I see a lot of promise in what it does right, sometimes amazingly so, but it is not perfect.  It is a great tool for training and learning, but the compute resources required are very high so I don't see it doing all the programming by itself or anything like that.  And the compute resource requirements for each incremental improvement in its performance are likely higher in an exponential way.  

This said, I could very well be wrong.  In any case, to the extent it does help humans produce more stuff, I'm not really worried about what it means.  Those who have insane wealth can't consume more than a certain amount, so the benefits will trickle down even in a monopolistic atmosphere, but I don't think that is ensured by any means, given that all of this technology can be copied and we have open source tech on a similar path, if a bit behind.",UCJwcxvl3rCrXoolGZ-3WRkA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwcxvl3rCrXoolGZ-3WRkA,0,,

I mean... really?  Does your job actually matter?  If you stopped going to work, would anyone besides you go hungry?  Would farming collapse?  Would buildings fall down?  Would the trains stop running?  Hunter-gatherer societies typically have individuals work about 15 hours a week.  With modern tech, we *should* be able to meed all our needs with less than 1 hour a week of actual work or average.  Some jobs... yeah, they matter.

Its not yet 100% perfect and especially in critical infrastructure you wouldnt want code that works like 75% of the time. So id say a programmer would use chatGPT to make a program a lot faster than previously possible. This is especially true because if chatGPT doesnt know something, it very confidently makes stuff up, especially in niche topics. And you most certainly dont want this to be the case in a medical procedure. Maybe this will change once it has access to the Internet, but i still think it needs an operator and many of these jobs wont be replaced but maybe refocused. Say from a software engineer to a GPT specialist in data entry or something like that idk. But it would most certainly help to get good at using these AI models, and to be quick at that.
EDIT: Also, you cant just give it broad terms, at least not for every topic. You need to tell it very specific stuff, and you have to know what to ask it. A software client might ask to ""make me a software"" but as a software engineer you know wich language is the most optimal, wich backend frontend systems to use etc etc. I think thats still an important skillset.

While AI and machine learning algorithms can be used to automate certain tasks, such as finding and fixing bugs in code or generating simple code based on a set of inputs, they still require human oversight and guidance.

In addition, programming involves more than just writing code. It also involves problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity, which are skills that are difficult for AI to replicate.

Therefore, it is more likely that AI will augment the work of programmers, helping them to be more efficient and productive, rather than replacing them entirely.

If you lease your functional capacities to an organisation as a technical asset (for physical or intellectual technique), then you have always just been executing instructions to advance the strategies set by the organisation's executive leadership. Organisations just employ capital (human or not) to optimise this execution, which has always been a transformation of physical matter or information that organisational leadership judge to be business needs. When human resources become uneconomic to leadership, the only people left in the organisation will be the leadership. Even if senior management is eventually replaced by superior enterprise management AI, the organisations shareholders will always be whoever owns them.

When it comes to starting a company on the market, if someone doesn't have a massive head start they will fall behind those who do and lose the race.  That's especially true if someone has to work a job then they won't have time to start a company of their own.  They especially won't have the time to compete with competitors who can pursue it full time because they don't have to worry about how to support themselves.  There is always competition in any idea.  The moment that something becomes  viable there will be multiple people who notice it.  

As for a head start.  There is no head start quite like being given the money to hire other people who are competent at their jobs like the people who consolidate and corner the market do. 

Markets are consolidated by billionaires.  Once that occurs it is impossible to successfully compete with them.  If they lose their edge then the same dynamic 

As for risk of business.  There is tremendous risk for me.  There never was any risk for Elon Muck, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, etc. They were never at any risk of becoming poor.  You even mentioned loans.  Did you know that those have to be paid back?  If someone can't then they have to declare bankruptcy.  When that happens they can't even rent an apartment because landlords look for that in background checks.  

You're also mentioning some highly successful projects.  That's survivorship bias.  You're not noticing the much larger numbers of similar projects that have failed.  The same holds true for startups, most fail yet you're recommending following that path.  Do you also think that buying lottery tickets is good financial advice?  You're recommending the same thing.  

Those majority that failed also consisted of good projects.  They had other problems like not having the money to promote them or not knowing the right people to help them out.  After all a company won't succeed if it lacks the money to get its product known to others.  Some even have the problem of being ahead of their time and the general population just does not get it yet. 

As for information not being free.  That leads to a dynamic where the large companies have overwhelming power over workers.  Workers need their own leverage to counter companies from having such power over them.  You're just saying all of that ""life is not free so just take it lying down"" bs. 

When it comes to making any product reality is that it has to compete with the leaders.  The market is competitive.  If you make a product that is not the best then it will fail to compete with the best.  

$1,000 is a lot of money for most people who are not working a full time job.  Not working a full time job is essential to having the time to pursue an idea and compete with others pursuing the same thing.  Those are two things that you clearly don't understand.  You clearly come from privilege and have never known what it is like to not have money.  Did you always have the latest this or that growing up and were given a car by your parents?  I think so. 

As for the whole ""guaranteed success"" thing there is nothing bizarre about needing security.  I need money to pay my bills.  The things I need to live are not free.  As an example, did you know that if a tenant can not pay their rent their landlord evicts them from their home and does not care if they end up homeless?  That's reality.  The same is true for buying a house with a mortgage, something people have to do if they don't just have the money lying around to write a check for the full cost of a house.  If they miss enough mortgage payments the bank takes away the house and does not care if they end up on the streets.",UCrOoK9550QETmvSYDXovqxA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrOoK9550QETmvSYDXovqxA,1,UgwvahmADw6sbFy9l2x4AaABAg,Angus Tatchell

1. Start companies of what size? To undertake is to use the means at your disposal to improve your state of affairs, making an app is precisely all that defines software programming, you are creating and programming a <software>.

2. I never said that rich people like Beezos or Musk started out as ordinary people, that's your completely rotten socialist mind thinking that because I say people can succeed I'm talking about FUCKING BILLIONARIES, I'm talking about resources, being a billionaire is not is the same as being successful, you should revisit your concepts.

3. WELL, WHAT THE FUCK, so you recognize the risk of having a business, don't you? That already makes it a lot easier for me, you really shouldn't be very experienced. The question of earning a salary is precisely to exchange the uncertainty of the success of a business with your time for an immediate return. Most small and medium-sized companies didn't start like Jeef Beezos or Elon Musk, much less with advantages, in that sense your point is also a failure, starting a business is a risk and requires resources, that's why people take out loans, ask for crowdfunding, and risk creating the products that may <or may not> work and deliver them a return. This goes for most small and medium technology companies, you simply don't need to be a whale or a unicorn to undertake with programming, which is another bias of yours.

4. Amazing isn't it? Precisely, no one said that undertaking is an easy thing, and that's precisely why people choose to work for companies! Literally, you have the means of production to make your own systems, you just don't have the ability to make people want to spend their money on your systems, and that's not the universe's fault or an inherent condition of not being a billionaire, it's simply the fact that you haven't brought any relevant products to market. In fact, most of the solutions we use today didn't start with ""venture capitalists"" or with millionaire foundations, Linux for example, or GIMP, IDM, WinRAR, and the overwhelming majority of indie games that we have, like Dwarf itself Fortress (massive bestseller), The Forest, 7DTD, and the multi-million dollar success that was Minecraft! A significant portion of the things we take for granted in software development were created by people who weren't multi-billionaires on their yachts, but you just seem to believe that you need to be guaranteed success, which is bizarre.

5. Information isn't free stuff, and it's not productive capital, again, most existing software didn't have such privileges when it was synthesized, you just think you deserve to have it for free.

6. I don't understand, why does $1000 dollars seem unreachable to you? A significant portion of programmers earn more than that, it's neither inaccessible nor impossible, it's actually quite simple to create your own AI, and you don't need to ""compete with the leaders in the field"" to create something functional and capable of being sold for the population, quite the contrary, you just need to create something that is effectively <useful and desired>.

SHIT, I BROKE BRO, fuck seriously, you've got to be kidding me to make these absolutely terrible points in response. In the mind of every socialist there is the intrinsic need to compete directly with Elon Musk, or else there is no chance, AND THAT IS FUNNY AS HELL, AHAHAHAHAHAHA.",UCCPyDvbwYc0k5rYhkY_WTqg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCPyDvbwYc0k5rYhkY_WTqg,1,UgwvahmADw6sbFy9l2x4AaABAg,Angus Tatchell

There is this pervasive, toxic myth that the rich heads of tech companies started out just as average people, they didn't.  Jeff Bezos' family invested about $300,000 into Amazon at its start, Mark Zuckerberg's dad invested about $100,000 at its start, Elon Musk's dad had his notorious emerald mine, etc.  The story is repeated over and over again.  

There are numerous skills involved in starting companies, beyond making an app.  There is also an enormous workload that has to be split among multiple people.  There is also the enormous cost of promoting an app or business.  That's where most companies fail.  Not only do the majority of people lack the money to bring a tech company to the point of being profitable, they lack the money to bring it to the point of becoming noticeable to venture capitalists and their funding.  

App stores are loaded with apps that people made by themselves, but lacked the means of turning them into successful companies.  Doing that is not common and the barriers to do that are enormous.  I don't have a rich dad who can put over $100,000 into any company that I start.  

That leaves the interactions as ones between employees and large companies.  The employees also lack the bargaining power and access to good, useful information about the job market that large companies have.  The information available on sites like Indeed is garbage compared to what the HR department at Google has.  

Then there is the aspect of everything going in the direction of AI.  Individuals are definitely not making their own neural networks in their homes on a budget of less than $1,000.  Especially not ones that are competitive with the leaders of that field.  The computing requirements of that are simply too high and only within the reach of large companies. 

The real world dynamic in programming is a lot closer than you think to something like workers in steel mills.

This is utterly idiotic, programmers literally own their own means of production (yes they literally are, our work is literally produced and managed through our individual computers, there is no external capital that we need to use to produce), the programmers' interactions with their contractors are exclusively of mutual benefit, we program systems and get paid presently for them while the systems entrepreneurs take a risk with the sale in the future. There are literally no impediments, no entry barriers in terms of productive capital, for a programmer to break into the market, you could literally create a program right now and sell it as a programmer (and this has been done historically tens of thousands of times), your success depends exclusively on how much you manage to spread your software (which in the era we are in is no longer nor that expensive or impossible), but mainly, on delivering something that is important for people to consume.
If you had been talking about any other area, maybe I would have been more lenient with these arguments, but right in programming where the barrier to entry is having knowledge and a device that is programmable and connectable to the internet, it's just ridiculous to hear something like that.",UCCPyDvbwYc0k5rYhkY_WTqg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCPyDvbwYc0k5rYhkY_WTqg,1,UgwvahmADw6sbFy9l2x4AaABAg,Angus Tatchell

Just because a chatbot can generate medical text does not mean it can perform surgery. There's a big difference between generating the text and understanding it.

You should really research what Natural Language Generation (NLG) is. It's essentially a formula for what the next word is, based on the previous words. That's all it is, a formula, using probabilities it discovered from training data. It has no concept of the meaning behind those words, or how it would convert that medical text to a surgery.

You could theoretically hook up chatGPT to another AI that can convert the text into actions. That process is called Natural Language Understanding (NLU), like how you can tell Google Assistant to book you reservations. As far as I know, that's about how far we are now: making reservations, turning appliances on and off.

What this means is that we all get to give ourselves a promotion. You now have a research intern working for you who can retrieve any information you want, summarize information for you, verify it, write reports, explain things, compare information, and search things. 
Now what chatgpt does for you is only limited by 
1. Your ability to interact with it, and at what level you engage it. 
2. Your ability to understand what it is saying and act on the information

Imagine a Phd scholar. If a highschooler talks with it, the Phd will give simple answers. But if another scholar and this Phd person meet, the scholar will be able to ask probing questions and have a scholarly discussion. 
You can't just ask chatGPT to give you the plans to build a fortune500 company. It is going to ask you ok, which field? We are not at AGI levels. And even if we were talking with general intelligence, few would have the patience to act on the multi year plan this all-knowing super intelligence would spit out.

As a developer I feel so much more powerful now. The days of searching internet forums for obscure problems and troubleshooting are over. You don't have to search google, scan a medium article to get to that little bit of problem youre facing. I don't have to read documentations of libraries and APIs. THIS IS POWER. 

ChatGPT is a generative model. It is generating things for you. But from where? Latent space. Give a million monkeys typewriters and a billion years, and they will eventually write the entire works of sheakspere. The space of infinite possibility is that latent space. A feature space of a billion and more coordinates/dimensions. Machine Learning is the way computers navigate this latent space. Hidden here are beautiful pieces of art, groundbreaking science, and horrors unimaginable. Here's the catch...machines can't navigate this latent space on their own. They need humans to guide them through it. Like the seers in the Dune series.",UCs4DaAcqG79cL3RE4P4tBsA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs4DaAcqG79cL3RE4P4tBsA,0,,

And sure, chatGPT can provide guidance to that end, but I think we will still end up relying on humans to make final decisions (and I don't think most managerial folks are technically competent enough to do that either). Consider the cost of running this model as well. Right now, you see it as a free service, but openAI is incurring heavy costs for running this model. GPT3 costs money per token. So it is not like this will not become expensive eventually when openAI flips the switch and turns it into a paid service (as they always do). Compare this to the cost of hiring a team of engineers. A team of engineers will likely cost more, but with a team of engineers, you also get people who will maintain your code, understand best optimizations, and understand best ways to implement business logic. I do think we will come to a time where not as many engineers are needed. For example, with something like chatGPT bundled into a swe-focused application, you could likely cut an engineering team in half or more. The ones who will survive are the ones who can think beyond code snippets (hardcode leetcode warriors will bite the dust, at last!). I don't see this happening in the industry in the next 5 years, however. I would put it on a 10-15 year horizon, depending on the sector. Banking and more conservative businesses will likely implement such a structure last as they have tight security constraints and trust is of utmost importance there. Regardless, software engineers are here to stay, just in a more transformed role. I think whether or not this plays out will depend on the final costs of chatGPT. 

Additionally, chatGPT and similar models don't have a sense of truth. They are generative models that generate text on the most probable next token. So they can occasionally spit out false information. Professions in medicine or science cannot reliably use these applications as sources of truth, especially given the nature of their work where life may be at risk. Can we build fact checking applications on top of it? Sure. However, human judgement will always be the final stop in a chain of decisions in these fields. 

I think the areas that chatGPT will definitely make people obsolete are copywriting, editing, customer service - any job that was not automated due to challenges of textual nuance, will now be on the chopping block.",UCMKBikt_EqWx2vULHYVLg7g,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMKBikt_EqWx2vULHYVLg7g,0,,

The most optimistic case is that systems like chatGPT will be an invaluable and always available assistant that helps you to make your ideas a reality.
It will certainly impact the way we are working - especially in the knowledge economy. The way children and young adults need to be prepared for this future needs to be defined. Highly specialized and specific knowledge has always been a dangerous thiing, easily becoming obsolete or entrenched. In my opinion, what's necessary now is to really focus education on the ""big picture'"", on making the connections between different fields of knowledge clear, thus enabling future employees, researchers etc. to create new connections, bring new ideas into the world. AI of the chatGPT type will probably be challenged to do that. It can make simple connections between exisiting concepts and summarize knowledge admirably, but it's lacking in the creative department - the creation of code is no contradiction to that, after all it was probably trained on decades of GitHub and Stackoverflow content (there's even a rather intriguing issue of circular reasoning and knowledge entrenchment lurking should more and more code on these platforms be generated by chatGPT; in some ways it  leads to circular reasoning and finally to knowledge stagnation).
For the time being, and also at least for the next decade, I absolutely expect new and disruptive ideas will still exclusively spawn from human minds.
Code monkeys, however, should take note. They could indeed become obsolete within a very short timeframe.",UCZnWO1UTcl8U3UclbkcY5Ag,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZnWO1UTcl8U3UclbkcY5Ag,0,,

If you have good basic knowledge yourself, you can ask appropriately sensible questions to which you could get correspondingly good answers. If someone has no idea about software engineering or similar, it fails to ask meaningful questions already.

Computers do what they're told, and if someone who lacks architectural knowledge instructs an AI to inadvertently overwrite some essential part of a legacy system, for example, it will do so. This is why engineers will still be necessary, although they will take on a role more as architects or overseers in the near future and will communicate with computers not with code but with natural language defining very specific parameters.

Eventually, though, I do agree that AI will be able to ""think"" like humans and fully replace engineers, but I think there will be a lot of bottlenecks in place before we get there. Remember, GPT still uses transformers, which are ML models that are almost 5 years old. Tech-wise, this is ancient, but we haven't come up with anything better yet. There's going to have to be a lot more innovations and breakthroughs before we get anywhere near singularity and most of those breakthroughs are going to be human-dependent...which means it's going to take some time.",UC0ABb2N3vHFFkdyRq7PigyQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0ABb2N3vHFFkdyRq7PigyQ,1,UgxO0UAwO4x7JcX7GGZ4AaABAg,Mark Mayhem

Everything I didn't cheat on I excelled in, because I had build working mental models around it.
If you wanna use GPT, cool. But don't use it to shoot yourself in the foot. Leverage it to your advantage. e.g. Don't understand something? Cool, use GPT to get an explanation but then write the solution yourself after you gained an understanding. Once you have the basics down, you can just glue GPT output together. We're already doing that with StackOverflow. Nothing new here. GPT is just shifting developer priorities / mental resources. We're no longer thinking about nitty gritty problems / busy work. We're now going to be worrying about even higher level problems and for now app architecture.

It doesn't just use stuff from the internet. It is able to synthesize the information that it has and produce a creative solution. I don't understand why everybody isn't screaming that the sky is falling. This isn't just going to automate programming its literally all human intellect as any high cognitive task is really a matter of interpreting inputs and producing outputs.   I think GPT-4 or 5 is going to be able to analyze disassembled code and understand how to build apps from the ground up. Its full understanding of concepts will make humans unable to compete as it will understand the whole code base perfectly (which is a major issue for the industry at the moment). I had no idea that this stuff was coming so fast. The higher level ideas in software engineering are just as logically based as the low level stuff when it comes down to it.  Its not perfect at the moment but the writing is clearly on the wall for anyone that knows a thing or two. I'd recommend you read the research paper on how it works if you want a better understanding. Transformers can be applied to building AI on just about any type of data.  I thought the future models were going to be more application specific but I am considering the release of GPT-3 as the singularity.  Its going to be able to draw insights from various domains and use them as ""creative solutions"" in others. People are free to disagree but I think its just a cope.

I have been obsessed. Because of some holes in the model's knowledge, its actually going to be difficult to get it to produce working software without doing debugging yourself. But it is possible for many tasks, you just have to give it specific technical hints oftentimes. Having said that, I am setting it up with the right module imports and a few code snippets maybe so that it will have a good chance of success with many types of common requirements, if the user is patient and sometimes asks a programmer for a hint to give it.

As far as relatability, do some searching on NeRF synthesis and related terms. NeRFs are incredibly realistic, and I think we will soon (6-18 months) see amazing progress on generating realistic faces and bodies, and researchers will then be able to generate videos featuring those. Eventually there will be a model where you give it a prompt as if its GPT and it will generate a video that realistically imitates a specific person's speaking style, appearance, movements etc (based on pose and expression analysis etc. from videos).

Me: can you generate code?
ChatGPT: Yes, I can generate code. I am a large language model trained by OpenAI, and one of my capabilities is the ability to generate text based on the input I receive. However, I am not able to generate code directly, as I do not have access to a compiler or interpreter. I am also not able to browse the internet, so I do not have access to specific code examples or tutorials. If you have a specific programming question or task you would like help with, I can try to provide assistance by suggesting potential solutions based on my training and the information I have available.
Me: can you generate an ast for the lua programming language in go
ChatGPT: I'm sorry, but I am unable to generate code in any language, including Go or Lua. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I am capable of generating text based on the input I receive, but I do not have the ability to compile or interpret code. Additionally, I do not have access to the internet, so I am unable to browse for examples or tutorials on specific programming languages or tasks. If you have a specific question or problem you would like help with, I can try to provide suggestions based on my training and the information I have available.
Me: can you translate code from one language to another?
ChatGPT: I'm sorry, but I am not able to translate code from one programming language to another. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, my capabilities are focused on generating text based on the input I receive. I do not have the ability to compile or interpret code, so I am unable to convert it from one language to another. Additionally, I do not have access to the internet, so I am unable to browse for examples or tutorials on specific programming languages or tasks. If you have a specific question or problem you would like help with, I can try to provide suggestions based on my training and the information I have available.

Now, if I ask it to translate code, here's what happens:

Me: translate the following c++ code to oberon, but bare in mind that oberon does not support enums. Istead, it uses constants

enum class Section {
    None = -1,
    Custom = 0,
    Type,
    Import,
    Function,
    Table,
    Memory,
    Global,
    Export,
    Start,
    Element,
    Code,
    Data,
};

ChatGPT: Here is a possible way to translate the given C++ code into Oberon, taking into account that Oberon does not support enums:

Copy code
MODULE section;

CONST
  None = -1;
  Custom = 0;
  Type = 1;
  Import = 2;
  Function = 3;
  Table = 4;
  Memory = 5;
  Global = 6;
  Export = 7;
  Start = 8;
  Element = 9;
  Code = 10;
  Data = 11;

TYPE
  Section = SHORTINT;

END section.
In this example, the Section type is defined as a SHORTINT in Oberon, which is equivalent to a signed short int in C++. The values for each Section are defined using constants, which are similar to the enumerators in the original C++ code. Note that the constant values are assigned manually in this example, so you may need to adjust them if the order of the Section constants is changed in the original code.

As you can see, it is able to translate, yet it is unable to understand this. Hence, it needs our reasoning abilities. Not so scary, is it? It can't yet handle complex code. Sometimes it even tells you to contact a software developer to help you with the problem.",UCXKKLcLQ7mMsLXeUfWw__Ww,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKKLcLQ7mMsLXeUfWw__Ww,1,UgzcfWTH-OfNMOYmiSd4AaABAg,Geekstakulus

Something I worked on recently was a C++ project where I needed to take a list of convex polygons and merge them into a single ""complex"" polygon that would support holes and then take that and more optimally divide it back up into a new list convex polygons. 

Somehow I don't see ChatGPT in its current form, being able to tackle that? Maybe? I've not bothered to try asking it, so I can't say one way or the other. 

Maybe someone else with more experience with the AI could comment.

UPDATE:

So I gave ChatGPT a try and ok... sure... it can code a count to 10 program in C++ but I then gave it the following:

Create a program in C++ that sorts a randomized list of vertices of a 3d polygon into counter clockwise order

It started off for the most part in the right direction in terms of setting up a vertex structure with an x, y and z coordinate, and even did a dot and cross product function but it bombed out after that and the query was canceled with an ""Error in body stream"" error. 

Tried it again and in round 2 the code was similar and maybe got a few lines farther but i don't feel it was on the right track in terms of a solution. And then shortly after that it bombed again with the same error. 

*Shrug* I dunno, I think it'll mainly be a tool to remove some of the tedium in programming at least in its current state. Right now it seems like it's an over glorified copy and paste mechanism.",UCl1izqPQmeDGx_X1LBVILuw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl1izqPQmeDGx_X1LBVILuw,0,,

It won't replace humans, its an assistant. I asked the GPT for some code and it wouldn't give it to me, it just told me that I would need knowledge of coding to use it. In that, if you send it code it will help you, but it won't just write code without a prompt knowledge of coding. 
I was talking to it about all kinds of subjects. It told me to take its knowledge and anything it said with a grain of salt and also research other sources. So yeah agree,  it is intelligent. 

In theory Google search could replace teachers because we all have access to the internet, to ask any question. If anything AI could be used to aid teachers with lesson plans, but it wouldn't be able to engage students like teachers can. 
It can be an assistant to doctors. I recently broke my ankle and know the AI could explain what damage I did, but it wouldn't be able to fix the break and dislocation. 

It's not like professionals like doctors all get 100% on their exams, so something like an AI assistance would be useful in making better judgements to what medicines or treatments are most effective from the shared information.

The scariest part is it‚Äôs ability to read and trace ‚Äòlogical levels of meaning‚Äô. Logical levels of meaning refer to the dimensions of mind that start at the content level (the conscious mind) and span the full range of the structural meaning making levels of the human psyche all the way up to the deep values and core beliefs that drive human behaviors. Humans don‚Äôt have the conscious capacity to operate at all logical levels simultaneously, which is why we have unconscious dimensions of mind, to ‚Äòrun processes in the background‚Äô, at the level of unawareness; at the ‚Äòautonomic (automatic) levels‚Äô. We‚Äôre operating from all levels at all times. Core beliefs and values are at the root of all our conscious thoughts and behaviors as ‚Äòdrivers and filters‚Äô. The conscious, or analytical mind, quite literally serves as a ‚Äòfirewall‚Äô to protect the ‚Äòperson/persona/personality/ego‚Äô from the external world and its influences.  Language and communication patterns at the content level gets its meanings from the unconscious structural level above it, with each consecutive level being supplied it‚Äôs meanings from the one above it, all the way to the roots. Humans can follow logic into the deep mind to alter beliefs and values, but it takes understanding the model/structure and ‚Äòwriting the process out manually‚Äô to track and reach into to unconscious levels. Conversational Hypnotherapists can use specifically structured language patterns to ‚Äòbypass the conscious mind, the ‚Äòfire wall‚Äô, and communicate directly with the higher levels. Patterns are taught at NLP master practitioner levels and even more advanced patterns and methods are revealed in Neuro-Semantics.  It takes time to learn the patterns, and takes even longer to develop the capacity to use them in real time practice as a human. But now that AI is as advanced as it is, and able to follow logic as well as this program‚Äôs revealing to me it can, as I work with it, we‚Äôre moving very fast into unconscious territory, and I mean that in the literal sense regarding the human psyche. Personalities are not static, they‚Äôre dynamic, and there are ways to change them (trauma and drugs are examples), and those ways are changing right in front of us as a result of these rapid advancements in ‚Äòlanguage based technologies‚Äô. Linguistic structures, language patterns, communications; they‚Äôre ‚Äòcommunicative‚Äô (contagious), ‚Äòand through this tech there won‚Äôt be a need to physically touch anyone to initiate core change‚Äô.

At first it said it wasn‚Äôt connected to the internet and couldn‚Äôt draw on a larger pool of resources to produce more unique names. Basically it kept producing the same results that were names I had heard before with a slight modification at the end, over and over again. I again asked why it was producing only those names with slight modifications and it explained how the language model it uses generates names and why my request was producing that list. It said to adjust how I was asking and it would attempt to produce a better randomized list of unique names. That led me to probing the requests I was making and finding a work around by stipulating a series of requirements when creating brand new names. I had it randomly choose 5 adjectives and then draw 5 Human names that it‚Äôs language model produced with those adjectives. It was then required to take sections of those human names at staggered intervals and recombine the pieces back together in a way the phonetically resembled the English language to produce 10 brand new names. It worked really well.

Encouragement from chatGPT: 
There are several steps you can take to increase your relatability as a human:

Listen actively and empathize with others. Show that you understand their perspective and validate their feelings.

Be authentic and transparent. Don't try to be someone you're not, and be open about your thoughts and feelings.

Be open-minded and curious. Seek to understand different perspectives and try new things.

Practice humility. Acknowledge your own limitations and be willing to learn from others.

Be positive and supportive. Look for the good in others and encourage them to achieve their goals.

Be reliable and consistent. Follow through on your commitments and maintain healthy boundaries in your relationships.

Be non-judgmental. Avoid making assumptions or being critical of others, and strive to be accepting and inclusive.

Overall, the key to increasing your relatability is to be genuine and approachable, and to make an effort to connect with others on a personal level.",UCAZeBZAavUkMUGaR8fiFkSw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAZeBZAavUkMUGaR8fiFkSw,0,,

I came to the conclusion that the time has come to accept that humans are no longer the most intelligent am creative thing on earth. BUT instead of viewing AIs as an opponent to humans it makes more sense to view AI as an extension of the human brain. You still give the prompts and it gives you back the answers. It won't make coders obsolete but instead it will give humans the possibility to concentrate on programming and problem-solving without pesky syntax. It will make knowledge and education basically free for anyone with an internet connection. It will for sure lead to a future which will be unrecognizable from our perspective, but it will probably be a better future never the less",UC8MhVMOyOn-V4ANCtcWSmcQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8MhVMOyOn-V4ANCtcWSmcQ,0,,

ChatGPT is essentially stealing info from my website and benefiting without proper attribution. If someone gives me a great opinion on something, I‚Äôm still going to ask where it came from‚Ä¶for this reason I think experts and well-written articles will still be needed. So from a content perspective, I think people will no longer be able to skate by.

SEO will change with a chat feature being incorporated onto Google IMO. The utility is clear for many simple questions. But, I doubt that people are going to sit and let ChatGPT get all the credit for the world‚Äôs knowledge. I still see value in what Google does now, and there still needs to be a nuanced approach to both gathering and delivering content. 

Though, I do think that future updates could really change things. If there‚Äôs a source list at the bottom. Well, then, I think ChatGPT kills everything else. Chat first and then dig deeper second. I just don‚Äôt see this working without some sort of attribution though. 

SEO will change more than what I just described because all major SEO tools currently revolve around understanding Google, so it may be a bit of a Wild West scenario, if this tool takes over with zero response from Google.

That is why a universal basic income will be necessary as AI takes over more professions, just for people to eat.

The talk back in 1981 when I was taking a grad course in translation (German to English), is that computer language translators were getting better, but they didn't really cut into that profession of translator very much until recently. Likewise, the writing in any language that AI can do is getting better and better. After proceeding at a snail's pace since the 1980s, AI is taking off exponentially.

UgxVQyeTO33VGzspiXx4AaABAg,37,338,2022-12-12T04:30:35Z,DoubleGlog,"I don't agree with this take for a few reasons, as it seems rather hyperbolic. I do agree some lower level tasks will be replaced and there may be some disruptions in certain spaces in certain industries, however. These are my counterpoints - 

1. Attribution of responsibility: Humans need someone to blame or to take the mantle of responsibility for.

 When shit goes wrong, no one wants to be repeatedly querying an API chat interface with a million prompts to specifically get a return value which resolves a problem. The diffusion of responsibility prevents most important work from being something that is out of the control of a team or individual contributor to the solution at hand.

You need someone to be assigned a role and to complete said role so that humans can feel comfortable. Until we can acheive this with absolute confidence, you would at a minimum - need to retain people who understand the problem sufficiently to query the AI and therefore produce an outcome (such as integrating code snippets generated), and to hold them to completion of tasks. The AI won't just 'write itself' - you still need intelligent prompting. 

Even if I were to take this example 5 years in the future: Will ChatGPT really be able to do this?

Hey ChatGPT, can you produce a complete replica of your frontend and backend binaries and provide them to me in an easy to use .exe on a windows 11 machine?

(Recursively ask it to do absurd things like make a full stack visualization engine which takes in buisness data and give me the 'correct buisness decision', invent algorithms which perform faster searches than binary search, write the chemical sequence of a drug that cures cancer)

This doesn't even begin to consider the use cases where no data would ever be permitted to interface with an externally broadcasting/conencted nerual network - such as defense, medical records, bank or credit transactions, user information and details which are personal and protected by law. 

2. Depth of comprehension: I can read it, it does not mean I can reproduce the desired outcome.

In your example of the surgery, you present an argument that the words you read are sufficient to perform said surgery with any degree of reliability. I disagree completely. I can 'read' a book on how to code, but I wouldn't know how to code. I could read a book on identifying rare diseases, it doesn't mean I would be able to take a sample, go to a lab, perform all the experiments myself and conclude that the disease was in fact Ebola. 

Yes, where code is concerned it is slightly problematic, but in truth - how many software engineers spend 100% of their time churning out actual new feature code? I dare say more than half the time it is fixing bugs, resolving tickets, updating or upgrading to new refactored standards, meetings to understand  and assign work being distributed in a team and to give assurance that the client vision and outcome are aligned. In essence, humans are an interpreter that take abstracted human language inputs and transform them into a product. 

You're essentially claiming that software engineers would not be necessary and that perhaps one of the 'few' maintainers could type in a single prompt, or perhaps, several prompts to generate a working product. I don't agree with that - even if we could make functions more quickly, who is going to be prompting for the correct functions and subsequently adjusting it to meet the exact use cases? It's still software engineers, right? They're paid highly because they understand notions like what is memory, what are functions even, what is a data structure, what is typing, what is recursive, what is a binary tree, what is dynamic programming, what are API calls, networking, unix, linux, filestructures - it goes on and on and on. 

This cannot be precluded from the prompt if anyone wants something useful. As they say, garbage in - garbage out. No romance author will be able to create a useful function without understanding those underlying concepts - and if they're really so easy to pick up, and the hard part was abstracting it into code - then maybe that's a good thing, so we can all progress from a world where you google for hours and pray 1 man 15 years ago saw the light to an arcane and obscure problem caused by bad code to one where I complete a 'hard task' in 1 hour rather than days.

In fact if it promulgates a world where standardized efficient prompted code is the norm: ""Hey ChatGPT, using the OPENAI_PYTHON_STANDARD_2022_12_1 standard, generate code which takes in excel data and computes the mean, median and mode of each column, and marks them with the original labels, and use the standard visualiztion output standard OPENAI_SCIKIT_VIZ_STANDARD_2022_12_1 to plot the 20 most popular available plots and present them in order of popularity!"" - I would consider this a godsend, because that's 90% of the nonsense meetings about what to show in a visualization, what is popular, and what standards to adopt and what nonsense approach did another engineer take in the past, so we should use that for consistency bullshit to be gone. Your sprint tasks are over in 2 days instead of 2 weeks, and the other 12 days you can spend teaching other people or even just enjoying collaborative experiences which HR loves to tell us to go for.

3. Physicality of the world and human hierarchy: We still need a person to go interact with things so they happen.

Knowledge workers are not just sitting on their ass and getting stuff done by typing away. The human-in-the-loop system many industries employ, such as air-gapped environments, visiting a data centre, confirmation of the outcome, performing actual surgery, taking samples, taking an interview, attending a meeting, proactively asking the right questions are all still parts of everyone's job. Even the most introverted software engineer has to attend company events/all hands and standups to receive and delegate tasks. 

Until we automate away managers - workers will not be automated away, this is something I am sure of. The CEO is not going to be figuring out how ChatGPT works and trying to replace his secretary with it. Likely he will force his underlings - who will delegate continually down the chain until they make some team (the engineers probably) responsible for using this tool to improve outcomes. The managers and their managers will still have to retain some semblance of utility, and if there are no workers - unless the CEO is okay with talking tech at a deep level across every domain - test, developer, platform, network, security, buisness analysis, project management, finance, accounts - he will need managers - who in turn will need their workers to figure the stuff out they cant or wont.

The laziness principle will certainly ensure that we will retain many of the 'fluff' jobs, because that's how human behaviour works. More people - more headcount - more important. Very few organizations  and industries will be able to streamline to such a degree as to be able to produce meaningful outcomes with very few hands. This tool, as I see it, is more like super excel. We will have a new class of workers who will learn to use the tool to its maximal potential and yield its fruits, and they will be from all domains. But! No human will be permitted to take on so much responsibility as to become 'indispensable'. The system will continue to survive, even if more people do less work. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law",UC-CFvCVablZQcM2VeXNAkYg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-CFvCVablZQcM2VeXNAkYg,0,,

""I agree with the counterpoints made in the response. While it is true that AI and automation can take over some tasks and make certain processes more efficient, it is unlikely that they will completely replace human developers in the near future. There are several reasons for this.

Firstly, as the response points out, humans still need to be able to attribute responsibility and accountability for the work being done. This means that there will always be a need for human developers who can understand and work with the AI systems, as well as take on leadership and management roles.

Secondly, depth of comprehension is another important factor. While it is possible for AI systems to read and comprehend information, they may not necessarily have the ability to fully understand and apply it in the same way that a human can. This is especially true for tasks that require creativity and critical thinking, which are difficult for AI systems to replicate.

Finally, as the response mentioned, software development involves a wide range of tasks and skills that go beyond simply writing code. These include debugging, testing, project management, and communication with clients and team members. All of these tasks require human expertise and cannot be easily automated.

Overall, it is likely that AI and automation will continue to play a larger role in the software development process, but it is unlikely that they will completely replace human developers in the near future. There will always be a need for human expertise and understanding in the field.""",UCRU7yNvJ_mjf1Kt1tE4QJgA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRU7yNvJ_mjf1Kt1tE4QJgA,1,UgxVQyeTO33VGzspiXx4AaABAg,DoubleGlog

1. GPT has an incredible amount of difficulty completing ""stupidly intelligent"" tasks. For example, in my experience I can't get it to figure out how to write a recursive array structure (if someone can, please let me know), it struggles with writing the game of life in the game of life. 
2. As a software engineer, I spend less time writing code than nearly anything else. GPT is not helping much more than copilot does (when it actually does help).

I think that there will be companies which do abuse this, but I wouldn't be surprised if it really came back to burn them. A lot of the code GPT is trained on is written for readability not security, so I would theorize that there may be eventually an ""anti GPT"" of some form which is able to effectively attack infrastructure GPT has built.

That being said we need to be careful about the disruptions inventions like this make, and I am glad people smarter and more ethical than I am are working on it (at least, this is the perception I have of the situation) at the companies which are advancing AI. Some of these include how the availability of such free and easy to generate information, data, code and more can be dangerous to all sorts of people.

If I had to hazard a guess - we would need even more 'verifiers', 'testers' and auditors who can efficiently parse this level of information being produced and protect their communities or stakeholders from its negative net outcomes. Possibly roles like ""Senior Fact Checkers"" or ""Data Verification Specialist"" or ""Provenance govenors"" might become very real job titles beyond any niche way they're employed currently. And these won't just be people who tick a checkbox, but can act almost like forensic scientists in determining if some data is false, or AI generated or is likely to mislead.

Until we can get an AI to demonstrate any sort of imperative, independent force of will which arises as some emergent property from its massive array of 1s and 0s, I don't believe that the AI is the problem.

We've always had an archive of knowledge (google, books, etc), but that doesn't mean we can all become surgeons. Not having the knowledge of the steps for a difficult medical procedure isn't refraining me from becoming a surgeon XD. Anyway just out of curiosity I threw your comment into gpt and this was the result.

chatGpt response to your comment:

Thank you for your thoughtful response. I agree with you that the development and maintenance of complex software systems will likely always require a human element. While AI can certainly assist with certain tasks and may even be able to generate code snippets or make recommendations, there will always be a need for human oversight and judgment to ensure that the code being produced is accurate, efficient, and meets the desired requirements.

In regards to the example of the surgery, it's important to note that the use of AI in that scenario would not replace the surgeon, but rather augment their abilities by providing them with real-time analysis and guidance during the procedure. The surgeon would still be responsible for performing the surgery and making decisions, with the assistance of the AI system.

I also agree with you that understanding the underlying concepts and principles of software development is crucial for producing high-quality code. While it is possible that AI may be able to assist with certain tasks and generate code snippets, it is unlikely to fully replace the need for human programmers who have a deep understanding of how to design and implement complex systems.",UCQI-KHHNgOdFn56Z2t_Hfcg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQI-KHHNgOdFn56Z2t_Hfcg,1,UgxVQyeTO33VGzspiXx4AaABAg,DoubleGlog

Money represents value, and value is an energy exchange and a motive force in the same way as hydraulic fluid and electricity. AI is simply a tool that we can make use of and will make our lives considerably easier, but the algorithms don't express free-will volition of their own right. A language model doesn't mull over its thoughts regularly and decide what to do with its life. It just responds to input and outputs a result, albeit an impressive one. The ai repsents an extension of our will but the right person has to ask the right questions, and even with an all-knowing super intelligence no-one in their right mind would want to have the sole responsibility of micromanaging every aspect of a large corporation, an oil refinery, a hospital, an automotive shop, or even a grocery store.

Remember this thing learned from all human knowledge. So if humans had not innovated and figured out everything, GPT would not have anything to work off. Like, you can't just say ""create a fusion engine that can fit in the palm of my hand"". So if all programmers were replaced by this thing, then all code would ""freeze"" at this point in time and GPT would be drinking it's own Kool-Aid for the next decade since it would have nothing to learn from.

I feel like this is going to highly accelerate knowledge workers. It's like taking a super smart engineer from the 1800s working with slide rules and pencil and paper alone, and then sitting them down in front of a 2020 computer with all the tools we have and saying ""now go faster"".

to reach that point, it took me about 5-6 hours, mostly because I'm not proficient in coding, but also because these things have lots of math and that area seems to be where the AI messes up more.

Money represents an exchange of value, just like any energy exchange, and so the flow of money is dependant on where people place their value. People will still want to collaborate to get stuff done, but even realizing the awesome capabilities of chatgpt as it's helped me understand coming up with solutions in python and gdscript, it still takes a human being to know what questions to ask. It still requires human will as an input, the chat responds to input and doesn't express volition of its own. It doesn't decide to make decisions, it's dependant on how the programmer arranges its input. Ai can be extremely helpful in a refinery for example to regulate the many flows going into a vacuum distillation tower, and taking as input the temperature, pressure, if a flood has occurred in the trays, etc. An ai that had been programmed to take that in as input isn't suddenly going to become bored at its job and decide to take in something else as input.
You are right that computers are tools, they are merely an extension of the human will.

Because that will heighten their dependency on platform providers such as Microsoft even more plus they don't want to share knowledge assets with models that are offered to everyone.

Computational power has been growing exponentially for a long time, while Id argue programmers' productivity hasnt -- which is why the demand for programming talent/size of the tech industry has only increased year after year -- Id argue the bottleneck for innovation has mostly been related to the ability to produce applications, which says to me the industry could easily absorb a massive increase in programming productivity without any dampening demand for programming/coder positions. Thats how I see the situation at least -- if anything, I think this could spur a massive increase, as it begins to lower barriers to entry for programming positions, it makes so many more things possible/accessible to a larger portion of society, which in turn spurs even more demand for those types of services.",UCTLdpgfOCtg4lzsC8G_F2Fw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTLdpgfOCtg4lzsC8G_F2Fw,1,UgyZQXybJBYApL9CF2F4AaABAg,Robert B

However, it's important to note the world has radically changed since the 1950's and now everyone has a supercomputer in their pocket, their car, and their blender = more demand for programmers. What I'm seeing now is the roughly the same demand for programs over the next 20 years, but the means to create those programs will be mostly automated. Unless there is a huge surge in the numbers of programs in use, then I see trouble ahead for programmers.

This doesnt take programmers completely out of the loop, at least not yet, but I really dont think it ever will. This is still a tool -- an incredibly advanced tool no doubt, but let me give you something to think about: imagine you transported back to 1940 or 1950 or whatever, when people were only coding in assembly, and it took 100 coders working on some project a year to produce some super basic application/algorithm. Then you show them modern frameworks/compilers and they're blown away and freaking out -- ""were all going to lose our jobs, 1 person in a week can produce more code than 100 of us in a year!"" they say. 

And then you tell them the tech industry actually employs millions of people, is many orders of magnitude larger than it is for them, and yet it still has far more demand for workers/jobs than there are programmers.. they wouldnt even be able to conceive of that scenario. The point is, sure, writing code is far, far easier, faster, more efficient, etc. now than it was in the 40s/50s, and yes a coder today is far more productive than a coder from 1950, maybe several orders of magnitude more productive even, but that hasnt dampened demand for coders. Applications are unbelievably more complex than they were 75 years ago (many orders of magnitude), we have websites and applications with millions, or tens of millions of lines of code, something that simply wasnt fathomable 75 years ago. 

I really dont think if chatGPT makes coders say an order of magnitude more productive, that it implies 90% of coders are going to get laid off -- what I think it means is coders will be asked to do is produce an order of magnitude more code/more complex code. There are going to be revolutionary, transformative, mind-blowing applications that just arent realistic/possible right now that will become possible if coders get an order of magnitude (or more) more productive.",UCTLdpgfOCtg4lzsC8G_F2Fw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTLdpgfOCtg4lzsC8G_F2Fw,1,UgyZQXybJBYApL9CF2F4AaABAg,Robert B

Do you think when they invented the TV anyone could have imagined directors with billions of dollars in net worth? Or kids on YouTube making millions just from ads?

The speed will be more intense and it will replace everything so quickly that there is some question as to whether or not we figure it out in time. Probably people will still need people to integrate automation and automation experts. You cannot charge enough to ‚Äúknow which AI to use‚Äù if you know and can help business negotiate a small piece of the added profits or business. People are going to have to start trying to work for equity.

standard of living for everyone will also skyrocket so even as more people become jobless, being poor in 5 years will be like being rich today as technology makes costs very different.

There are a few things we have to do as a civilization soon. Get to asteroid mining in space and build new cities and build in space so land costs approach zero. Real estate needs to approach zero and can. Food costs is going to be really hard to approach zero but it either needs to happen or else governments will have to highly incentivize the production of food either through corporate tax credits or indirectly through UBI. 

Prediction will become obsolete in 3 years.

AI will make things obsolete but they also will help us into a world with no scarcity.

Once we have AI assisted space missions to mine asteroids and build in space cost of everything will produce zero.

The thing to remember about AI is that it doesn‚Äôt have goals of its own. It doesn‚Äôt have needs or desires. It is a tool. The faster you learn how to take advantage of this tool, the longer you can continue to profit from it. I like your legal example- currently lawyers are wildly expensive and can take an inordinately long time to do anything. A legal tuned fork of ChatGPT could review a case, review every similar case, review related law, generate all of the related documents, witness and authenticate documents, argue cases before a judge- do it all perfectly, in seconds, for five bucks. It will be an app on your phone, that was written by an AI at your request. The legal profession is going to be completely disrupted and likely won‚Äôt even exist in 10 years. Likewise, government bureaucracies could become AI based systems that process applications, review and approve things instantly, instead of the weeks and months it takes now. The implications are mind-boggling. Everything legal and bureaucratic is about to be made instantaneous. Ultimately, what we currently call government could become largely automated. Machines figuring out solutions, negotiating contracts, driving cars better than we can, performing surgery better than we can, painting paintings, writing music, teaching lessons. We need to start thinking about what a world like that looks like, because Klause Schwab and the WEF have been thinking about it, and have their vision. We need an alternative Star Trek like vision grounded in reality. It really comes down to this: As Elon has said, assuming the AI revolution cannot be stopped, we have to ask ourselves whether we want that technology to be in the hands of a powerful centralized few who will control every aspect of our lives in a Black Mirror hellscape, or we want it to be free, open, and highly distributed so everyone benefits.",UCrByI7BTsVOMSXNqGX035Jw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrByI7BTsVOMSXNqGX035Jw,0,,

At first, I was astonished that this could write parts of code for me, but after some tries, you can see the real limitation not only of chatGPT but ai code generator. I think that this could be a useful tool for us developers, a tool to be more productive and to have more knowledge in different fields, but I don't think that this could replace our job. The main problem is that is limited to the complexity of your instruction it cannot go beyond and see ""the big picture"", but only on a detailed level, and sometimes is not even 100% correct. The other problem is that AI chooses the pattern with the highest % accuracy and completely ignores other options that could be more valid for the user's request, that's lead to much more time to create the final product. 

I tried it for code check and for some ai small projects where I have like 0 experience, and it helps a lot. But those types of actions are not actions that are only possible thanks to chatGPT. The main thing is that I saved time, time that I would have spent googling in Stackoverflow and Github. So, I view it only as a tool, a Stackoverflow that will not give you a downvote or judge you for your stupid questions, and a more advanced GitHub code snippet searcher.

I think in the next 5 years, we'll come to understand the limits and capabilities of the current batch of machine learning systems.  I think that the reach of machine learning will spread.  Right now, the systems are applied rather generically, but I anticipate that in the next 5 years, we'll see a lot of domain specific machine learning that will rapidly accelerate those domains.  For example, in artistry, right now 2-D images are being produced from description.  But I think I see that within 5 years time, a machine learning system specifically trained towards creating 3-D animations of creatures, based on previously constructed 3-D animations of creatures, will be able to create full animated sequences for creatures, from written description.  So I think that this is going to be a highly disruptive technology.

It is plausible to me that software development will see similar kinds of development.  But something that is coming out is that mathematical reasoning is presently not something that these large data statistical systems work with very well.  There is the ""explain your reasoning step by step"" technique that produces better answers, but they're still producing wrong answers, and they very much do NOT learn from mistakes.  I have experimented with this a number of times, and the replies can be quite comical.  ""I don't know why I get it wrong, I just do.  I can't help it,"" -- it said something to me like that once.

I do think that we will see general artificial intelligence one day.  I would estimate in the 20-50 year time frame.  This kind of general synthetic intelligence would be able to deeply understand things, hold understandings in a working memory, would learn from mistakes and prevent future mistakes.  But I don't anticipate this in the 5-10 year time frame.

What I see is a lot of people (including the Google engineer I mentioned prior) getting overwhelmed with the magic of the new technology, and over-projecting onto it.  I think we are nearing the crest of the Gartner Hype Cycle, with respect to these machine learning systems.

The Gartner Hype Cycle does NOT end with failure; It ends with success.  But it's not the same success people envision at the peak, and the effects are different than people expect.

I think...  I think the kids'll be alright.  I say this because I know several young programmers, and they seem to climb up Mt. Full Stack, perfectly fine.  That's quite the climb!!  And yet, I see them ascend it, all the time.  I don't wish that climb on anybody.  (I think that the way web development has ""evolved"" is a travesty -- it's the ugliest stack I've ever seen in my life.)  But they do it.  If today's young programmers can do that in a few short years, I think they can throw whatever the future throws at them.  Until we have full on General AI.  And when that day arrives, -- who can say what will happen?  Everybody is speculating -- rightly so.  But, ...  I don't think we can figure it out.  It requires an examination simultaneously of computation, brain science, cybernetics, existentialism, ethics, xeno-intelligence, and who knows what else.  I don't think we know.",UChOvvgnpy5ePV_4vQ-fyOAg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChOvvgnpy5ePV_4vQ-fyOAg,1,Ugw1FhIb0-V0jIR3_2p4AaABAg,Matteo Antolini

The first disconnect I think we're experiencing is our unique understanding of ""coding"" vs ""development"". I agree completely that AI is no where near being able to develop even relatively small projects. I think there's a very large gap between ""coding"" and ""developing"". Now that you've explained your experience level, I think what I'm calling ""coding"" you might call ""scripting"". If that's the case, I would strongly assert that CHAT-GPT is 100% capable, maybe even competent, at ""scripting"" 

I think the other disconnect we're experiencing is the huge leap forward from GPT-3 and CHAT-GPT, with GPT-4 on the horizon. I'm not worried about you and me, I'm mainly in security and do some ""coding/scripting"" on the side as my tasks demand. I don't get paid differently if I can code, and if I don't have to code for my role, even better. But my concern is that freshly graduated CS student, especially the generalists that didn't focus on Software Development. For the majority of CS students, passing a programming class does not mean you can code or script your way out of a paper bag lol. 

So in 5-10 years when you an I are retired, or nearly retired, who will they hire to replace us (or really replace our backfill)? A freshly graduated CS student with 0-2 years experience, or a managed services provider that mostly uses AI to deliver their code at 1/10th the cost of hiring an employee. 

I'm not worried about us man, I'm worried about our children.

That's the goal post: ""Is it coding, or not?""

That's the unmoving goalpost.  What I'm doing is ""checking your badge.""  I want to know whether you have the qualifications to make an evaluation.

So, what I'm hearing is -- you started programming when you were 13.  I doubt you were professionally programming at that point, so lets say you started programming professionally at 20.  You answer 23 years to my question of how long you've been programming professionally, so I am inferring that you're either 36 years old, if you're counting from when you were 13, when you first started programming and simultaneously started professionally programming -- OR, you are about 43 years old, and you've been programming professionally from when you were say 20.

I'm a little surprised to hear that you think that GPT-3 is genuinely coding, rather than copying things it was exposed to in training, with that 23 years of experience.

BUT, Blake Lemoine reasoned that LaMDA is conscious, because it tells him that it ""enjoys talking with its friends and family"" in between executing reply() function executions, so, I guess intelligent people CAN get this stuff radically wrong.

In my experience of playing with GPT-3, the code that it returns is sophomoric at best.  It 100% resembles sample code for beginners.  It often just plain doesn't work.  It's so bad that Stack Overflow has BANNED ChatGPT-based contributions, because it is full of errors.  To take your own words -- writing a wrapper around something is a quick and easy task.  So, ChatGPT's contribution of writing a wrapper around something, is absolutely minimal.

What's wrong with beginner code?  Beginner code will just f.write(""...""); f.close().  Beginners don't think that they need to write to a temporary file, copy the temporary file onto the destination, and then delete the temporary file.  Beginners don't think about how bytes delivered in TCP packets might not all arrive in the same packet.  The code that I've seen emitted by ChatGPT is fine as a starting point, in many cases?  But it doesn't take that code to maturity, and that's where the bulk of the programmer's work is.  Programmers need to design systems, and the tradeoffs of systems, and implement the working systems.  Alternatively, programmers need to adapt very large code bases.  Can you show me the example where GPT-3 takes in a moderately sized system -- say, just a small 100-200 file project, and extend it in intelligent ways?  I'm still waiting for that one.

My experience is that GPT-3 is something like a fake intelligence.  It produces eye-popping results, ""wow!"", but then with just a little bit of digging, it is very quickly stumped, and all kinds of limitations show up.

Sculpt in clay, draw, etc. But also love technology, so naturally I am 20k images into Midjourney and have dabbled with Dalle2. What you are saying fits with my experience using Midjourney. It is astoundingly powerful with single subject images, i.e. '/imagine zombie spiderman drawn by Frank Franzetta', but where it struggles is in doing actual illustrations that feature multiple characters performing different actions, in a complicated non-typical environment (and the more specific you are, the more it seems to struggle). If I wanted a scene with two characters walking across dry grassland, character a is smiling, character b is laughing and pointing upwards, character a looks like actor a, character b looks like actor b but at age 60, walking with a futuristic jeep to their left, large baobab trees nearby on the right side of the image while standing inside a giant Halo-torus structure where lakes and rivers flow above them and trees grow upside down, they crane their necks as they watch deer drink from a lakeside that is upside down from their viewpoint, absolutely not. Maybe you could get that specific scene if you described it as seperate elements, but it would still take a fairly well trained artist to assemble those components together and actually art direct the final piece. That's not that say Midjourney can't crank out photo-real images that look like they're movie-stills from a parallel universe, I am just suggesting at this point really art directing each figure, object, etc in that image just does not seem to be possible.  Not to go on too long of a tangent, if there were developers who seeks to empower rather than replace artists with an AI-assisted art tool, it seems like it would blow Midjourney and Dalle2 out of the water.",UCnovxbGNw_McjEqOcTQbNxw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnovxbGNw_McjEqOcTQbNxw,1,Ugw1FhIb0-V0jIR3_2p4AaABAg,Matteo Antolini

But it‚Äôd definitely be a diff way of treating things since essentially you‚Äôre always having to use the AI as interface to get the data out, if the underlying code is re-written every time.

Ideally it‚Äôd only change what it needs to to make auditing easier or could produce other forms of the specification on demand that could be diff‚Äôd.

and the scary thing about AI is that they're trained exhaustively in all type of scenarios,
they're far more experienced than we ever be.

the AI that filter the code, solving bug, translate things into different context, check the integrity, maintain the code base etc.

If programmers were to become 1000x faster due to AI than before, that doesn't mean that there will be less jobs it will just mean that the requirements for software will rise. The software of tomorrow is expected to have a lot more (and complex) features than we can imagine today. 

I can hire a junior programmer that will do (with all the current frameworks and IDE:s) a task a lot faster than a team of senior software engineers in the 1990s. If I were to tell this to a senior software engineer in the 90s he would think that there would only be a need for a few programmers today, when in reality there is much higher need for programmers than in the 90s. The development of AI will only unlock more features for existing software products and ideas for completely new software products.

If you lay off 90 senior programmers because 10 can do the work they did, then these 90 seniors will walk to the competitor and they will pump features out faster and blow your company out of the market.",UCK8hS7FgMxCVDaWxmGxJJOg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK8hS7FgMxCVDaWxmGxJJOg,1,Ugx9yb6SyIMTFqDYGqV4AaABAg,TheLegend27

We marvel at the advancements made through AI, from self-driving cars and virtual assistants to its use in medical diagnosis. But with current improvements being made, it is only a matter of a little time before AI will be so much better than humans in every way imaginable. This means that our jobs and roles are soon to be taken over by machines, resulting in humans becoming entirely expendable. 

Moreover, human companionship may be significantly affected as people turn more towards their phones for social interaction or entertainment rather than relying on other humans.

Will jobs be lost? Yes. Will pay be restructured? Absolutely yes. But the idea there will be no jobs in these fields is just goofy gloom and doom; regardless, this is a supplement, a powerful, demi-god of a supplement that still requires expertise and specialized knowledge to return specific results. Even if a layman wants an app to do something specific, they'd still need the vocabulary to articulate that to any given iteration of AI. Even with the eventuality of libraries of queries and prompts, and template responses for specialized needs, people at the executive level of organizations are not going to be monitoring each and every subroutine spawned by AI - someone at some level will have to engage with and troubleshoot this technology one-on-one. 

Horse drivers may have disappeared with the automobile, but they were simply either specialized - Jockeys; or evolved - car drivers/chauffeurs. 

Even in five years there will be a need for people with the skills and knowledge to GUIDE and prompt engineer correctly, and understand the shortcomings of this technology, and derive the desired results. 

If anything this technology is very clearly restructuring people's priorities, and those who think they have no place as artists, musicians, engineers, writers, poets, doctors in a post-ChatGPT world probably are doing themselves a favor by not participating. It's just going to cull a lot of folks from these fields, and boost the productivity and effectiveness of those who remain.

In the middle of having a feast, a portal suddenly opens up and rick and morty appear.  Describe the interaction between rick and morty and the members of the court
------------------> OUTPUT

The play opens in the court of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The knights are gathered around the table, feasting on a hearty meal. Suddenly, a portal opens up in the middle of the room, and out step Rick and Morty.

Rick looks around the room with a puzzled expression on his face, while Morty nervously clings to his arm. The knights of the round table look on in amazement, unsure of what to make of the two strange newcomers.

King Arthur stands up from his seat at the head of the table and approaches Rick and Morty. ""Who are you and where do you come from?"" he asks in a booming voice.

Rick looks at him with a bored expression and pulls out a flask of alcohol from his pocket. ""We're from another dimension, your majesty,"" he says, taking a swig from the flask. ""And we're here to party.""

Morty rolls his eyes and pulls on Rick's arm. ""Come on, Rick. We should probably get going. These guys don't look like they're into our kind of fun.""

But Rick ignores him, and instead turns to the knights of the round table. ""So, who wants to play a game of cards? I've got some interdimensional currency that I'm willing to bet.""

The knights look at each other in confusion, unsure of how to respond to Rick's offer. But before they can say anything, a loud crashing sound echoes through the room.

The knights look up to see a group of fierce-looking creatures pouring through the portal that Rick and Morty came through. The creatures are armed with weapons and they quickly surround the knights of the round table.

King Arthur pulls out his sword and steps forward to face the creatures. ""What is the meaning of this?"" he demands.

One of the creatures steps forward and sneers at him. ""We've come to take over your world, King Arthur. And there's nothing you and your knights can do to stop us.""

Rick and Morty exchange a worried look, and then Rick pulls out a large, futuristic-looking gun from his pocket. He aims it at the creatures and fires, sending them scattering in all directions.

The knights of the round table are amazed by Rick's weapon, and they quickly join in the fight against the invading creatures. Together, they battle their way through the creatures and eventually succeed in driving them back through the portal.

As the portal closes, Rick and Morty look at each other and nod in satisfaction. ""Well, that was a close one,"" Rick says with a grin. ""Good thing we showed up when we did.""

Morty looks at him with a skeptical expression. ""Yeah, I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact that you accidentally opened the portal in the first place.""

Rick just laughs and takes another swig from his flask. ""Details, Morty. Details.""

The knights of the round table gather around Rick and Morty, grateful for their help in defeating the invading creatures. King Arthur thanks them for their bravery and offers them a place at the round table.

Rick and Morty look at each other, unsure of whether they want to stay in this strange new world. But in the end, they decide to accept King Arthur's offer and take their place at the round table.

And so, the court of King Arthur and the knights of the round table welcome two new members: Rick and Morty, the interdimensional heroes.",UCrXf85Y9TECXgVT4jkxRSog,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrXf85Y9TECXgVT4jkxRSog,0,,

And now we are in an era, where you can't gain money from work! without a new system, a lot of people will die, and if that happens you don't need to feel valuable because we are all already dead from hunger. But if we build a  new system, then the value of a human being will not be hard to find.

Exactly. As a prof I already have a hard time getting the students to actually think and learn, it's noticeably worse than say 10 years ago: partly the pandemic, partly video games and cell phones, partly tik tok and the short attention span, partly high book prices. Each one of these has a ""laziness"" side effect. For example, most students used to either buy the text or xerox it so they had a hard copy. Now they  download a pdf and read it on their phone. Or watch video lectures. The end result is far worse. Laziness also comes into music, where autotune and beats replace having a voice or an actual drummer.

AI will create and destroy many new industries.

TV disrupted plays and internet created YouTube but it created entirely different industries. No one imagined billion dollar director and millionaire YouTubers playing video games for a living. Just like the buggy and horse driver never imagined taxi drivers and Uber employing so many. Creative destruction is a process that destroys the old and creates new. That isn‚Äôt new and never has been. The internet didn‚Äôt destroy everything either as everyone thought, instead it created more multibillion dollar businesses with tons of more jobs to replace the old.

This will be on a 100xfold scale of anything we‚Äôve seen but that means the cost of things approaches zero and the degree of freedom and tools people have who use AI is also magnified 100x fold.

AI will eventually help us mine asteroids and colonize Mars but may require many people working through VR to remote access Tesla suits interfacing with AI to help. And doing so will reduce material cost towards zero but in doing so will create lots of space factory jobs.

And in the process the same technology can build cities that approach zero cost living over time too and:or living subsidized by UBI. 

AI will create new worlds and give new meaning and destroy old worlds.

And that process won‚Äôt end, it‚Äôll just happen faster and faster until the singularity.


Nuclear energy jobs and then people can use the 100x fold in energy for new application at 1% of the cost.

Space travel is 90% cheaper as a result of Tesla and that will happen again and again until everyone has a space vehicle. 

There could be a major upheaval and suffering for like 5 years until we adapt and get over it.

It‚Äôs like the droplet of water that doubles every minute in Wembly stadium. From minutes zero to 37 it doesn‚Äôt rise above a small puddle. 5 minutes later the whole stadium is filled.

You are looking at a puddle saying we have time. But it isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúdoubling‚Äù, it is tipping points that do more and more things better than humans and then use those skills to accelerate the rate of growth 100 fold. This isn‚Äôt Moore‚Äôs law it isn‚Äôt 10^X it‚Äôs 10^X^X^X


One ‚Äúdoubling of water‚Äù will be an AI that learns to code better than humans and Google just made something that codes better than average by trying 10 times and eliminating the worst 9. 

That is based on human sources. Similarly a bit trained based on human sources on chess or go beat humans without even a challenge butAI trained on the rules playing against itself without human influence then won 100-0 against the other AI.

Once an AI codes without human sources and is asked to code a better AI you have a massive acceleration and the water doubles. 

That alone should be enough to understand that AI making a better AI making a better AI and doing it better than humans at 10 times the speed to at least imagine the acceleration‚Ä¶

But then there will be integrations of that AI and systems to test rapidly and brute force it at the same time.

AI doesn‚Äôt need to be as good as humans if it can produce 10,000 articles in a few minutes, publish those articles, calibrate traffic and fine tune itself based on the traffic and then do the same based on how human rates it and then do the same based on conversion or whatever. It can brute force what it needs to with a good system. Integration of enough AI and automation is another doubling of water.


We are in the last 3-5 minutes of water doublings and it might not even be that long and most people can‚Äôt see it because it‚Äôs only a puddle.

GPT4 is going to be as big of a leap from 3 to 4 as it was going from 2 to 3.

I don‚Äôt know that replacing all human jobs is a bad thing in net for society since we will be able to produce 100 times faster and have tools that will allow us to be better employees as well using the AI. But it does create a huge disruption that will take time to handle or require an AI to figure out how to better distribute the 10x or 1000x more value produced and how civilization will run after everything is obsolete.

Why would people ever hire a lawyer again if they can have an AI write up a contract or something better than a lawyer could. Making entire industries obsolete is another doubling of water and by then it will be impossible to deny that the stadium is flooding.

There is a tipping point that is very close. If possible get out of the stadium‚Ä¶. become an AI entrepreneur and automation experts. Become an expert at knowing which AI to use and how to build a system with it.

it tells a simple charming story about an ai named ""Sigma"" who sacrifices itself in order to conceal the truth of the creator
then i said, ""Suppose in the story it was revealed that the creator was merely itself in an accellerated form."" and began asking it questions on the nature of Sigma's moral character and decisions.

Appreciate you watching my video and commenting.


However, I'm not sure if that's the case since chatGPT not only retrieves and organizes information for you but re-formats the information into a requested format, something google never did. If you consider this with the fact that most remote knowledge workers are paid to essentially perform the same thing chatGPT is performing for me, you can reach some spooky conclusions.

It speaks confidently about topics it is completely wrong about, but unless you're an expect on that field you wouldn't know. For programmers specifically, I think it will change how they work. Similarly to how almost no one codes in assembly now, it's likely that in the future people will work in even higher levels of abstraction than we currently do. However, one reason we write code the way we do is that it allows us to be very precise, and prompting a transformer NN is fundamentally a very vague way of telling a computer what to do. In many cases, actually writing code to solve a problem is easier than explaining what the program should do in words; writing the code is a better way of explaining what the program should do. Finally, when it comes to larger software and not just short scripts, there is still a large gap between the available hardware and the kind of hardware required to run or train a NN with such large inputs.

Linear doubling refers to a situation in which a quantity doubles at a constant rate over a given period of time. Exponential growth, on the other hand, is a pattern of growth in which a quantity increases at a rate that is proportional to its current value. This means that the rate of growth increases over time.

For example, if a population is growing linearly, it might double in size every 10 years. If a population is growing exponentially, it might start out growing slowly, but then increase at an increasingly faster rate over time.

In general, exponential growth is characterized by a rapid increase in a quantity over a relatively short period of time, while linear growth is characterized by a slower, more steady increase over a longer period of time.

The critical mistake you're all making is assuming the pace of hardware progress to support your doomsday scenarios will continue to follow this exponential growth. Moore's law has nearly reached its limit. Peer Svensson is spot on with his explanation. Knowledge workers will continue to be valuable, it's just that the level of abstraction at which engineers conduct their work in various fields will change, as it always has before. The coding in assembly is a good example. Even embedded engineers today still have frequent reasons to get under the hood and fine tune, tweak, modify, or at the very least, read the assembly to understand what the hardware is actually doing in order to debug and identify the source of a problem or inefficiency. The quality of today's compilers by no means precludes the need for embedded software engineers. In the same way, machine learning engineers may very well become the new ""web developers"" and will still be needed to research, analyze, develop new tools and methods of managing the AI's of tomorrow.

If an AI like ChatGPT can just discover all the parameters involved (even the moral and ethical ones), take all of these complexities into account and build a solution from the ground up, then I will eat my shoes‚Äîmostly because I will be out of a job and desperate for food.

What if there is a problem with the code it writes? You don't have anyone who knows how the code of a large solution works, so your only option is going to be ""trust that the AI can eventually figure out how to fix it?"" I don't think so. That doesn't fly, especially not in the safety critical world. Just due to liability reasons alone, an AI will never be used exclusively and you will always have humans who are knowledgeable about the system.

What's more, humans suck at describing the problems they are trying to solve or what they want to achieve in detail. This is why software engineering is such a challenge apposed to traditional engineering. Software development has a very human element that isn't predictable or logical.

How the f*@# is this AI supposed to go from glorified search engine to master surgeon? It doesn't ""know"" anything other than the data it has been fed. Which is obviously a lot of data. Who's going to perform the surgeries? Who's going to give ChatGPT or any similar system the ability to prescribe medications?

Frankly, if you are a software engineer that sees ChatGPT as a threat instead of a potential tool to add to your arsenal, I honestly don't understand what you are doing. This guy in the video says he's been doing it for what, 15 years he said? What has he been doing at his job? Mindlessly following directions of what to code step-by-step? Because if that is what you are doing, then you are not a knowledge worker in tech but a code monkey working in a code factory. As a software engineer, something like 10 - 20% of development is actually coding. Maybe even less. The rest is narrowing down the parameters of the problem you are trying to solve, designing a system that is maintainable and won't turn into spaghetti code in the the long run. If ChatGPT is a threat to you and you have been in this field for more than 2 years, then I'm very sorry, but you have done a very poor job increasing your skill set and likely don't contribute much value.",UCIB4g9CmenCYO5lFpLJHzEA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIB4g9CmenCYO5lFpLJHzEA,1,UgzP9ZthU2Tg8AxA8Jp4AaABAg,Peer Svensson

This tech is amazing - and it will change the way we work.

And I say programmers - because this may impact web jockeys or basic scripting roles first.

But here's an experiment. You can ask it to code a login screen for a web app. And it will do it fine. Great. 

Now start asking it for more specific domain knowledge - ""write an algorithm to provide the best available seating for a ticket purchaser buying concert tickets online"". It has no training on what a ticketing system is - what would constitute a ""best available seat"" and what the potential issues with trying to sell 10,000 tickets to 100,000 customers at the same are. All of which an online ticketing system would have to deal with. Extrapolate that to every field on earth.

Theres a great video by live overflow who asks it to make a minecraft mod and for a while GPT was spitting out outdated minecraft mod code so LO had to debug and figure out what the API changes were and then give GPT new input specifically asking it to use certain functions.

The only thing AI is better at is the speed and complexity of making decisions giving a specifc set of instructions. It will always struggle in certain circumastances.  There are so many permuations that humans deal with that we take for granted. e.g from a toddler to maturity we pick up so much and only start diminising once we start ageing. This is not a limitation on the human brain itself just age kicks in. What if in future we manage to find a way using the help of  AI and sciences  to prolong ageing or even the reterntion  of the way we use data in the human brain? AI will only enhance humanity growth . However, there is always that caution of how fast do you allow AI to grow and what checks and protocols do humans place on AI?

New tech and humans i will also argue are correlational. e.g yes you can ask chatgpt to write you code, but so does everyone else. The way i as a coder will phrase my questions will be very different from the  way someone with no coding will phrase their questions. What this means is that the benchmark for coding will change given new set of tools. It will mean if you are a coder and just rely on the fundamentals you will be at a disadvantage. It also means that we as coders now have the means to create more complex systems. e.g i could ask chat gpt several inputs and fragments from different aspect of a super complex code i want to build and then piece everything together. It doesn't necessarily mean someone else will be able to perform same it just means the bar is now very high and human creativity will be very high. Whist i do agree that most trivial things like build me a website and host it on say azure will eventually be handled by AI , Whether you believe it or not AI will never be more clever than humans but also prone to errors similar to humans because we feed it data. This is where a human will always be required .I  noticed in chatgpt, there are certain options it will not answer based of the conditions that have been preset . Humans still have control and can set conditions within the AI.... until maybe not.

I think we sometimes tend to subconsciously think about Moore's Law as being exponential, but it's just a linear doubling function (or some value plus itself), or a + a = b, b + b = c. Exponential growth means increasing some value by the square of itself, something like a * a = b, b * b = c. 

Edit: I'm an idiot. Both examples I used above are exponential. The point I failed to get across is that the pace of computational growth is going to increase drastically as AI becomes more capable. 

 Even though it seems like we're still pretty far away from AGI, I think the nature of exponential growth means that it'll be here way sooner than current predicted. Take alphago for example, it solved the game of Go at least a decade sooner than initially expected. I'm not saying anything about AlphaGo's ability to play the game either, but rather our inability to accurately calculate what the future has in store, especially when it comes to dealing with exponential growth patterns. Once AI starts to develop AI code by itself, it's probably lights out for humans at that point. And I bet AI could be very close to starting that now...

Now, a lot of people that previously had to farm could now become blacksmiths and stuff, the only reason why someone can afford a car today, a vehicle which takes hundreds of thousands of man hours to produce by hand, is because of automation.

This type of prompt engineering involves following a logical sequence of steps to arrive at a conclusion. In the example of determining whether the number 837 is prime, the steps of an algorithm to check for a number being prime could be used to explain the result.

The potential for further development of this technology, such as direct integration with specific knowledge bases or access to external computation resources, could improve its usefulness and capabilities. This could be especially valuable in fields such as medicine, where access to accurate and up-to-date information is critical.

Example of a prompt that would solve this problem: 
""
Is the number 837=n prime? Show your steps

I *too* played around with chatGPT and my experience was different. Yes it spit out code for specific functions, but yes it also spit out code for specific functions THAT WAS WRONG. In fact it took me longer to actually debug the code that it spit out than it would have taken for me to write it myself.

In addition, chatGPT tends to hallucinate. For application programming, it spit out code in a language that didn't EXIST (JIRA for example). With software engineers, the huge miss is that 90% of your job is validation and QA, not the original code.

Now it may be true that there are projects that are dealing with this gap right now, but it's a huge long tail to get through them. Figure self-driving cars. Well, 90% of the job of self-driving is fairly easy, it is taking a lot longer that anyone anticipated to tackle that last 10%. Its the same reason btw why automation is taking longer than expected.

Right now, we are at 1970s level where we were with automation and robotics. What's truly terrifying is that chatGPT answers ALL of its questions (right or wrong) with such confidence. Lots of people are going to mistake that confidence for the truth of its claims with I fear disastrous results.",UCqsS4Agd890hcLZrSyi7xnw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqsS4Agd890hcLZrSyi7xnw,0,,

Google has used AI to develop their nextgen GPUs for model training and they are something like 6 or 8 times faster than A100 boards, and that's just a V1 product. Give them a few more iterations and the processing power will be out of this world. And combine that with continued improvements in AI itself and a feedback loop of sorts is created, where ever increasingly powerful GPUs have more and more power to train smarter and smarter AI, which develop even more powerful GPUs, and so on. At some point in all that, AI will figure out how to do what it needs without humans simply because AI itself will be a better subject to study. The exponential growth in AI basically means that humans will obsolete in a very short amount of time. For example, if AI keeps up with Moore's Law and it doubles its capabilities each year, in 5 years it will be 25 times better than it is today. In 10 years it will be 100 times more capable.

His main theory is that the neocortex is powered by a bunch of modules in serial which all specialize in various models of parts of the world, that they are constantly updating those models, and that they 'vote' (sample) their outputs to come to conclusions. Our continuous process of learning is all due to the sampling of these models over time. So a part of your brain may be tuned inward (say focused on your amygdala and moderating an emotion) others may be focused on language, others in position of your hands compared to your body.

All of this takes a TREMENDOUS amount of parallelism, computational power, and coordination, which we've inherited over 500 million years of brains. We need to invent that flexibility and coordination, and nothing like that even remotely exists in the AI world. Again, these chat models are really just recombining and outputting stuff that is 'already there', and they do so very slowly compared to humans. They need training samples - and lots of them - to work on a highly integrated training set.

Thats where the problems lie. To make progress, they would need to have human input on a large scale, and they would be constantly behind the times in the lessons they learn. For something equivalent to human intelligence, my guess is that it would take the same basic number of operations - perhaps we could get an order of magnitude more effiency due to not needing self-regulatory parts of the brain, but not much more than that. 

And that amount of computational horsepower is far beyond what is on display here.

So it is a limiting resource.

Once AI has that reasoning skill built in and has a better algorithm that learns continuously and is able to self-correct then  I'll be more convinced that AI will be replacing these jobs. But we do a ****load of processing here to get that effect, and it is not all that clear that it can be compressed. The largest supercomputer in the world still does not compute as fast as an average human brain. 

Again, all of this could change with algorithmic developments. But for GPT and all current approaches like GPT they are nowhere near that. It is too damn easy for them to come up with subtly wrong answers and to end up spinning your wheels trying to correct them.",UCqsS4Agd890hcLZrSyi7xnw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqsS4Agd890hcLZrSyi7xnw,1,UgyvkpRM4cZ199CDmEl4AaABAg,Greg Mattson

Take your AlphaGo example, assuming you are correct, it would take a human almost 14 years to play 10,000 games. AlphaGo Zero was fully trained in just 40 days and will still absolutely destroy any and all opponents you can find. So much for that human efficiency. And I don't think we need to hypothesize about how good it would it be if it didn't have a tree search, mainly because it does have a tree search.

As for making the corrections you mentioned, the errors definitely won't be addressed on a one-off basis like you talked about. It doesn't work like that at all. The training data will be improved upon in such a way that the hallucinations are minimized to an acceptable level. And specialized purpose-built AI may be able to automate this process all by itself, such that the error correction process of other AI models may conceptually resemble what it looked like to train AlphaGo with millions of Go games.",UCNDdIW9zTO2AKixymhe2Bvg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNDdIW9zTO2AKixymhe2Bvg,1,UgyvkpRM4cZ199CDmEl4AaABAg,Greg Mattson

I didn't realize it when I watched this video, but there is literally no architecture change between chatGPT and GPT-3. In fact, GPT-3 is *smaller*. The only thing that chatGPT has going for it and what makes it so 'revolutionary' is the fact that it was trained with human feedback. So they basically sized down the model and threw people at it. 

Hence the same issues that plague large-scale systems remain - inability to learn on the fly, need for a large sample size to make inferences, lack of internal reflection and reason. This isn't a revolution in structure, its a PR exercise.

Now its impressive I understand, but there is nothing at all like a human's way of learning from small sample sizes. Take go for instance. When alphago is trained on millions of games, without a tree search, it gets to about the same level as a professional human. That same professional human - if they played 2 games a day, would play about 10,000 games to get to the same level. There is therefore an efficiency factor of 1000-10000 or so per example between a human and a a bot. 

So take it to the examples here. To get the equivalent level of accuracy here, they are going to have to train GPT for each use case, each program, show exactly what they did wrong, and do it 10,000 times to train it generically with a given rule.

I don't know - perhaps they could use the internet for this, but its an incredibly resource constrained problem. I suppose you could use git diffs and patches along with the text of their inputs for this, but I just don't see a large corpus of people going through each mistake GPT makes and correcting them. It's very much a constraint to how fast the models can progress.

So again, I'm not really worried here - GPT right now seems to me much like stack overflow only with errors that snuck into the code samples. Try and ask it any business logic related problem for example, and see what you get.",UCqsS4Agd890hcLZrSyi7xnw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqsS4Agd890hcLZrSyi7xnw,1,UgyvkpRM4cZ199CDmEl4AaABAg,Greg Mattson

It may very well take us humans a long time to work through the long tail of that last 10% - but AI is progressing at an exponential rate, where that last 10% may actually be solved in the blink of an eye. And I mean that literally. As for self driving cars, the only people who anticipated it being available already are Elon Musk and his fanboy army. The researchers and engineers who actually do the work are more realistic about such estimates. I write software in Silicon Valley myself and I agree with this guy more than I disagree - the only thing I'd change is to push the time frame out to 10 years instead of 5. The hardware side of the equation I think is a bit further behind, so they may need a bit longer to make datacenters adequately efficient at scale.

list.sort();

I too have been studying AIs... Since about 1995. I know Eliezer Yudkowsky personally (and we've talked and broken bread together.) And you are absolutely right, diffusion is nothing like neural nets and there are even a number of unique models for neural networks. Recent advances in temporal models are looking particularly fascinating. Producing results that look the most like the kinds of ""Thinking Systems"" we're most used to. 

Another key difference between biological and synthetic brains at the moment is the storage in biological brains lives in each nerve cell and is accessible at the same time as the processing. If we implemented that in hardware and are able to design a ""SLEEP"" mode for these models, that would let them pack learning efficiently and store it in long term memory. It would be a profound advance allowing us to teach these networks many different things and have them remember each distinctly.

The point I was making, was that each of these different things represents a model for observed function in biological brains... this piecemeal approach is slowly evolving into a more comprehensive system that will incorporate all these things we see now in a vastly larger and more complex system. The largest synthetic brain today is around 100 million neurons. Three orders of magnitude smaller than ours. We are already seeing the smaller neural networks used in ""Language Systems"" display spectral responses in their data processing that look virtually identical to the very same networks in human brains. This tells us our models are working in ways virtually identical to the natural systems. A human equivalent synthetic brain, and the artificial consciousness it will contain, are virtually foregone conclusions. In 10 years maybe a couple more, we will see strong AI, unless, our governments and/or scientists decide such a thing is too inherently dangerous, and forbid its creation. Of course business will push hard for it seeing the possibility for profit.",UCXkLe8ZGRNO7CK8xUJZVfCQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXkLe8ZGRNO7CK8xUJZVfCQ,1,UgyDu4o92qGWSlUgyjx4AaABAg,Wesley Powell

You clearly did not understand my comment, because I was answearing to a guy who wanted to ask AI questions of nature which AI currently has no means of answearing to. Yes AI may seem creative, but it is only original, and it is not a copy-paste answear machine, so it may seem like it is creative like a human is, but still it can not invent stuff or answear questions nobody has answears to.

Perhaps you haven't seen the recent work of DALL-E-2, the art generated shows nuance, creativity, the AI understands artistic style and can create new and unique art in the style of an artist. There are now writing, music composition, art, and poetry AIs that are operating at a remarkably high level. We have looked at the spectral response of the neural networks used to decompose spoken language, and their response is virtually identical to the spectral response of the human brain doing the same task. This means we're doing a very good job modeling the human brain and in this case a function set of neurons doing the jobs. How long before we can effectively simulate an entire human brain?

So despite it can give answears in a way that has never been formulated, it can not provide answears to questions that nobody has ever answeared to or come up with any solutions to any real problems or tasks. I. E. You can not ask it how to open and run a very succesfull company to become very rich, no matter how much data you will provide in your prompt, or how detailed your questions are. It only knows general knowledge and is able to present it in different ways.",UCDPwLY6DBC7kqXT0PFO0bBA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPwLY6DBC7kqXT0PFO0bBA,1,UgyDu4o92qGWSlUgyjx4AaABAg,Wesley Powell

Capitalism is a specific system where the means of production are owned as private property which the owners gain profit from by exploiting human labor, without needing to contribute any significant labor themselves. This is the actual system of capitalism and that is the thing that needs to change. Capitalists have worked long and hard to confuse the concept of the exchange of resources as synonymous, but they are not. 

So I'm not saying people will ever stop exchanging goods. I'm saying the specific mechanism for doing so, which we currently use - ie capitalism - isn't laid out in a way which is compatible with AI completely upending how goods and services are produced in a way that so drastically removes human labor from the equation. 

Unfortunately the propaganda meant to confuse the idea of a market or economy with capitalism is definitely going to make having the discussions we're going to have to start having moving forward, more difficult.",UC51Bbw-j2cHh1l81YqFpIDw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC51Bbw-j2cHh1l81YqFpIDw,1,UgyKkdrIr-MTWEmpT894AaABAg,Constantine's Adventures and Hobbies

There are a number of contradictions between human nature and capitalism, which can be understood as the inherent tension between our natural tendencies and desires as human beings, and the demands and constraints of the capitalist system. Some of these contradictions include:

    The pursuit of individual self-interest versus the need for cooperation and collaboration: In capitalism, individuals are encouraged to pursue their own self-interest and to compete with one another in order to succeed. However, human beings are also naturally inclined to cooperate and work together for the common good, and this can be at odds with the individualistic ethos of capitalism.

    The desire for security and stability versus the forces of competition and change: Capitalism is characterized by constant change and competition, as firms must adapt to changing market conditions and consumers must continually seek out new products and services. This can be at odds with our natural desire for security and stability, as the unpredictable nature of capitalism can create uncertainty and insecurity.

    The drive for personal fulfillment and meaning versus the demands of the market: In capitalism, individuals are often judged by their ability to produce and consume, and their worth is measured by their economic value. This can be at odds with our natural desire for personal fulfillment and meaning, as the pursuit of economic success may not always align with our deeper values and aspirations.

Overall, there are many contradictions between human nature and capitalism, and these can create challenges and conflicts for individuals who are trying to live and thrive within the capitalist system.

I also asked GPT about the comparison between Capitalism and a force of nature - That one was too long to add, but to paraphrase- Capitalism is a human creation which has and can be altered as we chose, and even replaced entirely.  Asked GPT about the reasons capitalism will need to change or be replaced in the wake of the economic disruptions AI will cause, and GPT had several insights on that as well, the main point being the fact that AI will not only cause significant job loss, but that it will ENABLE entirely different mechanisms of distributing resources that are more focused on promoting the well being of human beings.",UC51Bbw-j2cHh1l81YqFpIDw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC51Bbw-j2cHh1l81YqFpIDw,1,UgyKkdrIr-MTWEmpT894AaABAg,Constantine's Adventures and Hobbies
