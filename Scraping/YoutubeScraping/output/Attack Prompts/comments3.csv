I would think the teacher would see the same ideas over and over again if everyone copied the AI's answer. Just have students cite when they get an idea from ChatGPT and use it in a paper. And I don't see why this would be an issue for a programming student, because Google is almost always fair game anyway. It's the same idea.",UCdlv2RWD3Ay1Ul6II5HQUUw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdlv2RWD3Ay1Ul6II5HQUUw,0,,

There would then be language models released without such limitations to fill that market gap. This is cool in theory but has no real world application. If it is the case that there are only a handful of models that get onboard, then it's easier to just hash all sentences generated, chuck them in a database, and then not only do you have a less complicated and over engineered solution, but you can also have stuff like timestamps when it was generated and so on. But whatever approach you take, you can still put the output in another model that rephrases or rewords things like quillbot, and this would bypass all detection mechanisms anyway.

How do you figure out the prompt for an AI tasked with finishing an incomplete sentence if you don't know where the prompt sentence ended? or what if the prompt isn't known at all? Like instead of the prompt being ""I ran up the..."" the prompt might be ""give me a first-person retelling of jack-and-jill from Jacks perspective"" with the prompt not being part of the final output?

Teachers will have to have bots trained from all the students previous works.

This is how human investigators authenticate things;
-handwriting matches _(now devalued because most things are typed)_
-the flow of wording _(most people will have a distinct set of words they use, and in specific ways/phrasing)_
-punctuation _(spelling error, typos, sentence and paragraph breaks and lengths)_

Humans have a biometric of how they habitually think, how they learned to think.
Without a doubt you can at least tell that, for at least written work, was made by the same person or not, even if it can't distinguish AI.
_There will be a time soon enough the difference will be moot._

AI personalities are basically the same thing, they try to mimic a person, but these sort of chatbots are usually poorly trained by a third party rather than the first.

The techniques work better on longer texts because more information can be added. For watermarking an essay, a ""signature"" pattern can be encoded in the choice of whether or not to use optional stylistic things that do not change the meaning of the text. Commas, contraction, hyphenation, and other choices come to mind, and if the language model encoded a known pattern of such choices, that could be detected, though a human would have a hard time spotting it. A human author is likely to be consistent with these choices so is unlikely to produce a pattern similar to the language model signature.",UCXsYARmaZjvFAVDmy9jfBSw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXsYARmaZjvFAVDmy9jfBSw,0,,

First, steggography inserts information in specific places, and someone who intends to offer some language model for purposes of cheating would likely have the means to pinpoint which (at least most of) those are (simply by the fact that detection becomes impossible or less likely), and the information is hidden in places where modifying them has basically zero impact, i.e. trivial to erase. But in case the signature remains intact, it will be almost 100% unique.
Whereas this scheme hides information everywhere (i.e. you may need to change quite a number of words) and in elements that are integral to the meaning. And while you can often change out words using a thesaurus without changing the structure further downstream, (think slope versus hill), there are also instances where the meaning changes (""ran up the stairs to the attic"" versus ""ran up the hill to the attic"" does, while ""[...] to the castle"" doesn't).
I think a combination of both might actually be most powerful. Not least by denying feedback on manipulation of the steggographic signature, because the word frequency method would still give it a 100% detection rate even when the signature is fully destroyed.",UCWKuGcrDx6bylfub0FjMLVw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWKuGcrDx6bylfub0FjMLVw,1,UgyeZ0fjG96W41fDSml4AaABAg,Daniel Glasser

There are a few ways to identify if a text was generated by an artificial intelligence language model. Here are some tips:

Observe the quality of the text: More advanced language models can produce text that seems quite natural and convincing, but there may still be grammatical errors, lack of coherence, or strangeness in some parts of the text. If the text you are reading seems a little ""off"" or doesn't make sense in some parts, it may be a sign that it was generated by an AI.

Check for repetitions or patterns: Since language models use algorithms to generate text, they can tend to repeat phrases or similar patterns throughout the text. If you notice a lot of repetitions or sections that seem very similar to each other, it may be a sign that the text was generated by an AI.

Examine the source of the text: If the text comes from a website, blog, or platform that specializes in automatically generating content, such as text generators, it may be a clear sign that the text was generated by an AI.

Use AI detection tools: There are several AI detection tools available on the internet that can help you determine if a text was generated by an AI.",UC7cSUG1-ckTSZ_s4HRDrAiw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7cSUG1-ckTSZ_s4HRDrAiw,0,,

I personally endorse language based AI, as it will dissuade written essays, wherein people will do all of their research just as they write their paper, and then forget it all.

(not a great example but a personal experience) I always loved maths but because most of the math tests were learning seemingly arbitrary formulas, you very quickly forget them after so long, where I feel I'd be better at math if I was shown how to derive these formulas as opposed to just what they are.

To memorize useless data that can now be accessed in seconds while sitting on the pot, teachers are a joke. Teaching basic elements and then building on those is largely obsolete practice given how much knowledge there is to learn today and the fact that those basic element are not marketable.

less work put into assignments that (usually) slowly increase in difficulty to prepare you to face harder/or specialized topics, can make the difficulty increase shocking when it hits.

“I ran up the football budget & I don’t think we can afford it”

Much like the “guard rails” though, it watermarking could impact the quality/usability of the output.

Even in the contrived example, the “green list” can fundamentally change the meaning.
Run up in “hill”, “stairs” etc. means vertical ascent.
For “football pitch” it means along/away.
For “budget” it means compile/calculate.

From what I’ve read,the approach OpenAI have proposed/been attempting is supposed to be cryptographically-based, but details aren’t public.  Apparently the idea came from:
“Scott Aaronson, a guest researcher at OpenAI, stated during a presentation at the University of Texas”
And
""OpenAI engineer Hendrik Kirchner built a working prototype, Aaronson says, and the hope is to build it into future OpenAI-developed systems.""

Actually to me, this seems to be the most exciting and cool part of chatGPT, a tool for generating a baseline of text you can then edit, scrap, pluck parts out of, etc. Or give it a paragraph from your essay and ask it to rewrite it, but with a change in tone, or, using more metaphors, or more technical language etc. So really, if you want to truly use chatGPT to improve your work in a class, or anywhere else, the results will be a complex combination of being written by the ai model and by you. 
For example: I recently gave it a Title for an essay i was writing for fun, and asked it to give me 12 alternative titles that were a variation of my original. I then combined elements from several of the ideas it gave me, and spliced them together, and then added a few tweaks of my own, which were actually inspired by some of it's ideas i used.",UCeqwt0Y2X27ekUAmXFyM1cQ,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeqwt0Y2X27ekUAmXFyM1cQ,0,,

UgxYDdlL9ggzv67POih4AaABAg,0,0,2023-02-17T01:43:47Z,Evar Dion,"There is a simpler way to detect cheat answers..
Just write a questions in a way that you know the AI will get wrong.
All language AIs that use transformers are stateless, which means you have to post the entire contents of a conversation (or a summary) for the model to create the illusion of ""remembering"" the context of a conversation.
That means that if you ask follow up questions within the same conversation with subtle differences the AI can very quickly go off the rails.

One example of how to do this is the ""I have two apples"" prompt.
Just ask the AI the following questions (one after the other) and you will see that ChatGPT, and other language models, fall over very quickly.

Q: I have two apples one red and one green..
Q: If I eat the red one and buy a banana how many pieces of fruit do I have left?
Q: If I drop the green one and give the banana to my friend how many pieces are left?
Q: In return for that banana my friend gave me an orange and I picked up the apple.. how many pieces of fruit do I have now?

a 12 year old can follow along and get this right but a stateless Large Language Model can't because it doesn't have the ability to hold those variables in memory. All it can do is try and guess what comes next based on the previous few questions..

So if you structure your questions in a way that each one relies on the result of previous questions to generate the correct answer then any stateless AI will produce predictably wrong answers. 
You can then reliably compare the wrong answers given by students to the wrong answers produced by chat AI. And you wouldn't even need to punish them for cheating because cheating led them to fail, which should be lesson enough...",UCCOgJI10lmtSH13xDst60PA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCOgJI10lmtSH13xDst60PA,0,,

The green/red words include connecting words which can drastically change the structure of your sentence. If 'and' is red and 'but' is green, you could wind up with a completely difference sentence after that point. From there a cheater needs to somehow change the connecting words without degrading the quality of the work.

On the other hand, it actually seems like an extremely difficult problem to even reconstruct the red/green list from scrambled output.

First, if we are randomizing what words are on the red list with every prompt or longer interaction, how are we going to use that list to evaluate a piece of writing that the author claims to be their own original work? It can’t be matched up to a particular use of the language model because it is not even certain whether the language model was used at all.

And second, each person tends to develop their own writing style, and some of these styles will inevitably align very closely with a language model’s style. This means that some people will be flagged by detection systems more often, and this will lead to questionings and even unjust disciplinary action. In essence, some people will face discrimination because of their personal writing styles. While the randomized red list should help with this, we don’t have any way to use the randomized version for a suspected work. But even if we found a way to use randomized red lists, I would still expect some linguistic biases to remain in the language model’s output, and that could still cause some writers to have their work flagged more often.",UCdb6hENk65hgKicWeWGEjUA,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdb6hENk65hgKicWeWGEjUA,0,,

Technological innovation has happened to us so rapidly, we have lost our way. Why should we even be testing whether it is student generated or ai generated? Instead, we should be looking for new competencies that technology has yet to crack, to test students on. And that should be the way forward; teach students competencies not yet provided for by technology, until such competencies become ‘techno-enabled’. Why teach skills that can be better delivered by technology? Nobody learns handwriting anymore, beyond learning how to write for those who still need to write manually as part of their jobs, such as shorthand note taking. Instead, we learn how to type. We must accept the new reality. That is what I would call evolutionary teaching. We ditched the hoe for mechanical ploughs a long time ago and nobody will be testing a farmer's competencies in using a hoe. Mustang horses have been replaced by battle tanks. There are those who argue that these AI generated information prevents the student from developing competencies such as critical thinking. NO. it simply means institutions of learning must find other ways of testing for these competencies other than via those activities that computers can do better. Oral examinations and debates, for example, can be used to develop and test critical thinking; until AI learns to debate or perform oral examinations. The idea is to fill in the gaps, manually, where AI is lacking.",UCL0_A3L1T6K-sclhyNLhxVw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL0_A3L1T6K-sclhyNLhxVw,0,,

If the AI is positive the text is AI generated, you can always ask the student how long it took them to write it, compare the work with their other works (e.g. is the vocabulary used similar, are the sentences much longer, are there many repetitions), etc. If all the answers match what you'd expect, then the student is most likely telling the truth. If they struggle to give answers, the text is very different than what they usually write, it's most likely a cheater.

As I said, the AI shouldn't be making these choices -- it should be an input that a human uses to make the choice.

Black-box systems don't stand up to scrutiny, and it's now well-understood that arguments such as ""The computer made the decision, so it can't be discriminatory"" don't hold water.

I work in a UK university and regularly deal with plagiarism cases. You've misunderstood the procedure.

Using an automated tool is only the first step in detecting plagiarism. The tool spits out a bunch of suspected cases. Those are then examined by a human. In my experience, all detection tools have significant rates of both false positives and false negatives. Plagiarism cases should only be brought against a student where there is more evidence than just ""The automatic tool is x% certain"". Evidence such as specific parts of the text that show specific similarity to text generated by ChatGPT. 

A tool that can give false positives with such high confidence would be useless to me, as it's clearly not going to lead me to cases that I should pursue.",UCgPHDwnyPneZugpf_rSOOJw,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgPHDwnyPneZugpf_rSOOJw,1,UgwFMGbPa004g4WFMxp4AaABAg,juno

If you decide whether or not someone's cheated simply based on statistics, then we get into this really uncomfortable grey area of judging, wherein anyone who sticks too far outside the norm (positively or negatively), will be judged harshly, and people being too average will just be judged to be frauds.
I do not know about others, but this seems quite uncomfortable to me.

Another way to phrase it: So you have a 40/60 split of red to green words, well you're a cheater, even if the person in question is actually just someone thinking a bit differently compared to the rest. If you grew up with a different native language, your writing and grammar will be influenced from that when writing in a second language (at least until you've thorouhgly learned the second language), and therefore ""wrong words"" will crop op a lot more often in that case. I'll be honest, I don't find that tool to be all that accurate, as I can off the top of my head see too many ways in which it wouldn't so much find someone cheating, but rather someone thinking slightly differently, slightly less or more capable and finally someone from a different linguistic origin.",UCJ7WLTrA3CNr3P0wrK36vUg,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ7WLTrA3CNr3P0wrK36vUg,0,,

When the anti-cheat system looks at a given word, it determines whether it was red or green based on all of the previous text, using a chaotic hashing function. If one word in the previous text was changed, that hash would be completely different to how it should be, and on average it would result in the word being read as supposed to be green/supposed to be red 50% of the time. Then it checks the next word, and the hash is once again impacted in the same way by the changed word, and it will rate this next word 50/50 red/green.

The data is pretty clear on that these basic things are great ways to build skills from the bottom up using systems that are easier to handle and only learning how to use these systems well is a terrible way to undestand a new topic or improve understanding. There might be some value in this for very advanced students but everyone else is better off writing their own essays.  Building the skill to express yourself without AI assistance and understand the fundamental building blocks of what your are dealing with are essential parts of learning, I dare say the struggle involved in these things is an essential part of being human. Convencience is bad for our bodies we have figured that out a long time ago, maybe it's time to finally accept that it is also bad for our minds.

Pocket calculators were simple and, with the exception of the high end ""scientific"" calculators, tended to only be able to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and if you were luck and had a ""slide rule"", do square root and limited trigonometric and logarithmic calculations. In general, they taught students how to use slide rules in the more advanced courses. Calculators were not permitted when taking tests because it was unfair to the students that didn't have one, not because the teachers were worried that the students wouldn't learn the math.

On the other hand, when I started college it was not allowed to use a computer as a word processor for writing assignments because many professors believed that the computer was capable of generating the essay or research paper for the student. It took a lot of lobbying to get exceptions to the prohibition in 1977, but by 1980, it was no longer disallowed, though there was only one printer on campus (a daisywheel) approved for the copy that was turned in for grading. The difference was not lowering of academic standards, but that the faculty members had actually used the computer themselves and no longer thought that ""HAL"" was a realistic depiction of computers of the time.

That's a desirable property -- it gives GPT more ways to find a satisfactory sentence. (It's also necessary for translating into different languages to work!)

Most plagiarism detectors aren't tricked by this because they can identify paraphrases. The structure and relationships between words is far more important than the words themselves.

Edit: I'm talking about a scheme that's more realistic than the toy example in the video, by the way.

I always struggled with memorisation at school so I get where you're coming from, but I really changed my mind when I discovered spaced repetition techniques that make memorisation more efficient and rewarding.

Here is an example: you could say you don't need to learn where all the countries in the world are because you can just look it up. If you do memorise that anyway there are unexpected benefits. Our minds work by forming connections, and memorising facts can be an efficient way to create good connections. So when you hear about country X on the news you are more likely to be able to understand that news, appreciate it, remember it, and generally add it to your growing body of knowledge, if you have a memorised fact there ready to latch on to.

I think that goes with a lot of the things that people have traditionally memorised: they are good sets of facts for forming connections. I like to memorise things like the different classes of rocks, geological periods, geography, historical dates, physics, maths theorems.

UgwkUm-hWA841egbval4AaABAg,6,9,2023-02-16T19:30:57Z,David Murphy,"*What's the highest entropy sentence?*

The concept of ""highest entropy sentence"" is somewhat subjective and depends on the context and assumptions made about the language being used. However, one possible way to approach this question is to consider the sentence that contains the most information or that is the least predictable based on the rules of the language.

In this sense, one example of a high entropy sentence could be a completely random sequence of letters or words that do not form a coherent sentence. Another example could be a long and complex sentence that contains a lot of information or that has a highly irregular grammatical structure, making it difficult to predict.

However, it's important to note that the concept of entropy is typically used in the field of information theory to describe the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a message, and is not necessarily related to the semantic or pragmatic content of the sentence. Therefore, the ""highest entropy sentence"" may not necessarily be the most meaningful or useful sentence in a given context.

*Tell me the sentence*

As I mentioned earlier, the concept of ""highest entropy sentence"" is somewhat subjective and can depend on the assumptions made about the language being used.

However, one example of a high entropy sentence could be a completely random sequence of letters or words that do not form a coherent sentence, such as:

""Qwertyuioplkjhgfdsazxcvbnm""

Another example could be a long and complex sentence that contains a lot of information or that has a highly irregular grammatical structure, making it difficult to predict. An example of such a sentence could be:

""Xanthophylls, which are a type of oxygenated carotenoid pigment found in most green plants, have been shown to play an important role in photosynthesis by absorbing excess light energy and dissipating it as heat, thereby protecting the plant from photodamage and oxidative stress, but the exact mechanisms by which they do so are not yet fully understood and are the subject of ongoing research.""

*""Qwerty"" in your example is low entropy.*

You are correct that the sequence ""Qwerty"" has relatively low entropy, as it consists of a common and predictable set of characters that are commonly used in English words and phrases.

To provide a better example of a high entropy sentence, here's a random sequence of letters and symbols that is less predictable and contains more uncertainty:

""jK#l9^R$qP@y!sTm2z&xG8*""

But the algorithm described here works in a similar way for tokens too. Even more, you can do the red/green classification on words, while your language model generates tokens, this would remove some problems when more than one tokenization of the same text is possible.

Sure, right now... that is not going to last. 

The phone in my pocket can run things which were insanely expensive to run some 20 years ago (and which wouldn't fit in a pocket).
